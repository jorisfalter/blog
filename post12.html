      <h1>Get out of the way of people delivering the work</h1>
      <p>The incentive for Product and Project Managers is to inject themselves as much as possible in the business:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Have lots of meetings with many people to discover synergies
        <li> Setup one way of working which everyone has to follow, to make progress tracking easy, and uphold an
          appearance
          of discipline
        <li> Do regular follow ups with the team, to “know everything” to answer questions
          from management
        <li> Try to make big changes because changes attract the attention from senior management
      </ul>
      <p> My approach has been quite opposite, and in my opinion it has resulted in faster delivery of projects and
        significantly more motivated team members.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, my philosophy has two pillars:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Get out of the way of the people delivering the work
        <li> Write excellent reporting
      </ul>
