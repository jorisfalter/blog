      <h1>Get out of the way of people delivering the work</h1>
      <p>The incentive for Project Managers is to inject themselves as much as possible in the business:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Have lots of meetings with many people to discover synergies
        <li> Setup one way of working which everyone has to follow to make progress tracking easy.
        <li> Do regular follow ups with the team, to be able to “know everything” and being able to answer questions
          from management
        <li> Try to make big changes because changes attract the attention from senior management
      </ul>
      <p> My approach up to now has been quite opposite, and in my opinion it has resulted in:

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> - faster delivery of core projects
        <li> - significantly more motivated team members
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short, my philosophy has two pillars:
      </p>
      <li> - get out of the way of the people delivering the work
      <li> - write and do excellent reporting
