            <h1>Amsterdam Vs Thailand</h1>

            <p>For almost a year we live in the Amsterdam suburbs now, after 5 years in Bangkok and one year in Phuket
            </p>

            <p>My wife is Dutch, I’m a Dutch-speaking Belgian. So the Netherlands feel close to a native country,
                while in
                Thailand we were real foreigners.</p>

            <p>Every couple of days a thought comes up of what I like here and disliked in Thailand, or vice versa</p>

            <p></p>I tried to keep track of these, and put them in a long list</p>

            <p>In the end it should help us make better choices for the future</p>

            <p></p>Because we do know, that Amsterdam isn’t our final destination</p>

            <h2>Amsterdam Pro</h2>

            <p>Let’s start with the good in the Netherlands:</p>

            <p>I love infrastructure, and for that the Netherlands is amazing. The public transport is not Swiss or
                Japanese, but it’s close. The bicycles paths are the eight world wonder. No country is probably as safe
                and
                convenient to ride a bicycle . The highways and public roads are in perfect shape and continuously
                improved.</p>

            <p> The public playgrounds for our 1 and 3 year old are amazing as well</p>

            <p>Counterside is that a small part of the population seems to enjoy trashing playgrounds, trains and buses
                and overall public spaces (we'll come back to this).
                Eating and drinking should probably be illegal on public transport like in some places in Asia.
            </p>
            <h2>Amsterdam Con</h2>
            <p>An overall lack of optimism. Sometimes even apathy. Sometimes I wonder if people have no hope in Europe.
                Especially young people. People feel they have a 100 reasons to be fearful, so they don't smile.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>Thailand (Phuket / Bangkok) Pro</h2>
            <p>I don't know how better to express this, but life is EASY when it's warm. I walk outside and jump on the
                bicycle or motorbike, the kids play outside, the people are more enthusiastic. It seems very different
                to be spontaneous and enthusiastic when you're huddled into your collar against darkness, wind, rain
                and cold. I tried it and it takes an active effort to walk upright when the whether is bad.
            </p>
            <h2>Thailand (Phuket / Bangkok) Con</h2>
            <p>It's too hot. My wife will disagree, but the warm season, when the sun burns vertical on my head, it's
                unbearable for me. This will get worse with climate change probably.</p>
