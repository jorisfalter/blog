      <h1>Is Digital Nomadism reaching a saturation point?</h1>

      <p><i>Thoughts after living in Phuket one year</i></p>
      <br>
      <p>I'm convinced the popular digital nomad destinations are very close to reaching their saturation point.</p>
      <p>The end game is that a couple of new hotspots have emerged which haven seen their real estate prices rapidly
        rising, and which will continue to do so.
        They are the new hotspots for remote workers and people trying to find a better life. They are the remote
        equivalent of business cities like London,
        Amsterdam, New York and Zurich.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>We lived in Bangkok for four years. Then we moved to Phuket, hoping to find paradise.
        Instead we found an island which was a big construction site for new gated communities with pool villas, a Wild
        West real estate market driven by Airbnb rentals, Thai inhabitants willing to monetize their land, Russians and
        Chinese eager to invest in it all, and
        a utility and road infrastructure not able to cope with it all.
      </p>

      <p>We found heaps of construction in new private schools, and new private hospitals, and willpower but no
        execution power to improve the airport.</p>
      <p>We found a nanny but it was harder than in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>Coworkings are popping up.</p>
      <p>What happens in Phuket is probably similar in all touristic destinations suitable for long-term stays:
        real-estate prices will rise dramatically, roads won't be able to cope with traffic, and the rich will prevail
        :) </p>

      <p>Let's clarify 3 things here:</p>
      <p>(1) The stereotype digital nomad is the tech geek hacker typing away in a coworking while drinking coconuts on
        the
        beach.</p>
      <p>But it's broader. Phuket was full of westerners who just buy and rent out some properties on Airbnb. The Nomad
        Real Estate investor? There are also (young) retirees spending their days investing in the stock market. Anyone
        who can run a business from abroad.</p>

      <p>(2) The new hotspots are places like Bali, Phuket, the broad Lisbon area, Mallorca, Malaga, the broader Costa
        Del Sol.
        Probably some places in Mexico and Costa Rica, but I'm less familiar with that area.</p>
      <p> All of these places are near the sea, and have nice weather.</p>
      <p>Some other common features are an international airport, decent healthcare, access to products you get at home,
        ... In short, a critical mass of similar people so the ecosystem is big enough to feel like home, but better.
      </p>
      <p>(3) The abundance of cheap air fares makes global travel accessible for everyone. The abundance of information
        makes it easier than ever to know where to live, where to buy, what the prices are.</p>

      <p>Phuket saw it's real estate prices jumping every since Covid. Similar things happen in Bali, Mallorca.</p>


      <p>Living abroad makes lives easier in many ways. Far away from friends and family, one can start the new life he
        always dreamed off. There are less rules (or less enforced) and often a possibility to pay less tax.</p>

      <p>These hotspots are not replacing the cities - London and Amsterdam will still be expensive. The new hotspots
        are merely
        opening a new option for everyone wanting to work remote. These options are now being rapidly picked up by the
        wealthy (similar as to cities).</p>

      <p>What's next after that? Cities and regions have network effects. New York grows bigger and more expensive every
        day, while rural villages go empty. Similarly, people will prefer Bali over Lombok, Phuket over Krabi, and
        Mallorca over the mainland.</p>
      <p>The ones who can add new targets to the list are governments. The Philippines, Indonesia, Greece and Italy have
        lots of potential. Africa as well. </p>
