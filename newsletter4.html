            <p>Monday is the day I burst with ideas.</p>

            <p>Couple of things I thought about today:
            </p>
            <p>1) My birthday was last week, a reminder to think about retirement. I calculated that if I would do a
                full
                stop at 65, and wanted 3,000 usd per month for me, and 3,000 usd for my wife, up to 90 years of age, we
                would need 1,800,000 usd.</p>
            <p> It feels like a tangible number now.
            </p>
            <p> 2) A friend of mine went on a meditation retreat. My initial reaction was to ask which one. My second
                reaction is that most retreats help you come to rest. I have a pretty wide array of tools to come to
                rest,
                so meditation retreats are probably not my best option.</p>
            <p>Instead, I want retreats which
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Bring me out of comfort, like ice-baths, jungle-trekking, ultra-walks, extreme sports like white
                    water kayak, …

                <li>Allow me to meet cool people, like fellow digital nomads, freelancers, entrepreneurs, …

            </ul>
            <p>The challenge is to find these in and around Bangkok.
            </p>
            <p>3) I like to work from coffee bars, preferably a local, independent coffee bar. But I also like to keep
                my weight.</p>
            <p>The problem: I feel bad taking space in a small coffee bar for two hours while ordering one or two teas.
                Alternatively I could order a smoothie and cake, but that would end up in me looking like an elephant.
            </p>
            <p>I don’t feel this guilt in Starbucks, other coffee chains or hotel bars, as they are mostly empty. I can
                comfortably sit there 3 hours while ordering one tea.</p>
            <p>For now I’m going back to the chains or hotels bars. It’s not an ideal solution, but the best one for
                now.</p>
            <p>With that I wish you a great week from the Lobby Lounge from Bangkok’s Sint Regis.</p>
