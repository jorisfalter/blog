One way to easily reuse the same header for different pages on a static HTML website is to use the HTML `<include>` directive. Here's an example of how you can do this:

1. Create a separate file called `header.html` that contains the HTML code for the header section, including any CSS or JavaScript files that you want to include. For example:

 html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
  </body>
</html>


2. In each of your HTML pages that needs to include the header, use the HTML `<include>` directive to include the `header.html` file. For example, in `index.html`, you can include the header like this:

 html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website - Home</title>
    <include src="header.html"></include>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>This is the home page</p>
  </body>
</html>


You can do the same for your `about.html` and `contact.html` pages, like this:

 html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website - About</title>
    <include src="header.html"></include>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Learn more about me</p>
  </body>
</html>


 html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website - Contact</title>
    <include src="header.html"></include>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Contact me</h1>
    <p>Drop me a message</p>
  </body>
</html>


You can also use this approach to re-use other sections of your HTML code, such as footers or navigation bars, by creating separate HTML files for each section and including them in your pages using the `<include>` directive.
