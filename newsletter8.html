                While the rest of the world has mostly left Covid behind them. In Asia things open up more slowly.</p>
            <p>
                Japan only last week opened its borders for foreign tourists. In Thailand, despite the borders having
                been open since the beginning of 2022, rebuilding the social fabric takes a while.</p>
            <p>
                This week my spouse has school holidays, and we’re spending the week on the island of Koh Lanta.</p>
            <p>
                Koh Lanta has one co-working space, KoHub Tropical Coworking, which has been closed for the last two
                years,
                it opened this week.</p>
            <p>
                So on the first Monday of our holiday, I knock on the doors of the co-working space. And 3 friendly Thai
                women look at me with an astonished face. They open the building, turn on the lights, show me where I
                can
                get tea.</p>
            <p>
                It feels I’m bringing this place out of hibernation.</p>
            <p>
                Firing up the internet takes a little longer (thank you 4G for saving my ass so many times). And also
                the
                hipster coffee bar isn’t operational yet.</p>
            <p>
                I haven’t been here before Covid, but looking at the sheer size of this place, it must have been a
                bustling
                co-working.</p>
            <p>
                Later, the friendly owner tells me before Covid there used to be a 100 people every day.
                Here comes my dilemma. </p>
            <p>I hope this becomes a bustling place again soon. You can just feel how much
                energy
                this place used to have before.</p>
            <p>
                But if it becomes a bustling hub again, it will also mean mass tourism is back. And we’re back in the
                overcrowded 2019s.</p>
            <p>
                In the end, it’s not in my circle of influence, every pro has its con, it’s best to accept the
                situations
                which you cannot influence, and take them to your heart!</p>
            <p>
                Have a good week from Kohub!</p>
