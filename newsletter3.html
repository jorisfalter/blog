            <!-- disclaimer -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height:15px"><i>This newsletter was originally published on the Revue
                    platform, which Twitter
                    (now X) killed after
                    being taken over by Elon Musk. I now republish it here. My latest newsletters are on <a

            <!-- newsletter content -->
            <p>I live in Bangkok. Last week my spouse and I started planning for our next destination. Probably
                something in Africa or South America.</p>
            <p>When I was 12, I didn’t expect this life.</p>
            <p>The itch was there, I always wanted variety, something new.
            </p>
            <p>I wanted to change schools because I was bored (I didn’t eventually).
            </p>
            <p>I went to study at 3 different universities because I was bored.
            </p>
            <p>I wanted to change jobs every time routine kicked in, typically after 6 months.
            </p>
            <p>What I didn’t realize was that I can live the lifestyle of variation.
            </p>
            <p>I was told:
            </p>
            <p>Get a job, buy a house, get a promotion, get children, …
            </p>
            <p>Today that just isn’t true anymore.
            </p>
            <p>Software development requires you to have nothing more than a laptop. English is the lingua franca for
                many jobs around the world. And remote work allows you to work from everywhere. Time zone permitting.
            </p>
            <p>So we chose to live in Bangkok a few years back.
            </p>
            <p>With a little baby Iza now, we want a quieter environment for our little one. And we believe we can find
                a great environment for our child(ren) to grow up.
            </p>
            <p>A famous rapper used to sing: <i>If I can see it, then I can do it, if I just believe it, there’s nothing
                    to it.</i>
            </p>
            <p>The world is at your feet. Go conquer it.
            </p>
            <p>With that, I wish you a great week from the Lobby Lounge from the Hyatt Sukhumvit Soi 13!
            </p>
            <p>PS our baby Iza slept through her first full night since being born 3.5 months ago! So I’m super chilled
                out today.
