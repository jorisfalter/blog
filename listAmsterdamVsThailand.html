            <h1>Amsterdam Vs Thailand</h1>

            <p>We moved to the Amsterdam suburbs one year ago, after 5 years in Bangkok and one year in
                Phuket.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Every couple of days a thought comes up of what I like and dislike.</p>

            <p>This article is to keep track of these, to help make choices in the future.</p>

            <p>Because we do know, that Amsterdam isn’t our final destination...</p>



            <h2>The Dutch Infrastructure is Great</h2>

            <p>I love it when things run efficient and predictable, that's why this comes first. I guess I'm a little
                autistic, probably with a bit of ADHD on top. I digress, in the very first sentence of this article
                already!
            </p>
            <p>The Dutch infrastructure is amazing: the bicycles paths are the Eight Wonder of the Wrold, safe
                and convenient, there is no comparison.
                The highways and public roads are in perfect shape and continuously improved.
            </p>
            <p> Public playgrounds are ubiquitious and challenging, for our kids, ...and for me as well!
            </p>
            <p>Trains and buses go at high frequency. They're less punctual than the Swiss or the
                Japanese, but because off the high frequency it doesn't matter that much, I'll just wait and my
                transport will show up soon. The bus lanes and train
                routes
                are optimised for speed and the public offices continuously improve them.</p>
            <h2>Hope for a better future as a key variable</h2>
            <p>And that's is a common thread for me: <i>continuous improvement</i></p>
            <p> In the Netherlands - at least for
                infrastructure - there is hope on improvement if something is wrong today.</p>
            <p>Case in point, we had a little sand path in front of our house which people used as a shortcut (an
                <i>Elephant Path</i> in Dutch). I emailed
                the city
                and they made it into a paved path.
            </p>
            <p>When things can be improved, it generally will be done.
            </p>

            <p>Nevertheless, despite the great infrastructure, and despite the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken window theory</a>, there is
                more trash around than I
                would expect. In playgrounds, trains, buses
                and public spaces overall.
            </p>
            <p>In some parts of Asia, eating and drinking on public transport is prohibited, it keeps at least trains
                and
                buses spotless. </p>
            <p>That would be solving the symptom though, because the real problem lies deeper...
            </p>
            <p><b>There is no Optimism</b></p>
            <p>Remember what I said about improving infrastructure? There is real hope that Dutch infrastructure
                improves year over year. We can see it, we can feel it. It was the same in Bangkok, they were building
                everywhere, it gives a sense of optimism. </p>
            <p>Less so
                elsewhere in the Dutch society, there is an overall
                lack of
                optimism. Sometimes even apathy. </p>
            <p>People don't smile easily here. Worse, people seem to be afraid of each other. Smiling to a stranger
                feels
                inappropriate. Let alone talking to him or her.
            </p>
            <p>Could the Lack of affordable housing be a reason? They really missed the ball on this one in last decade,
                and for us it's the reason to move away in 2026 when our rental contract expires.
            <p><b>Aging Population</b></p>
            <p>Other than housing, I believe
                the median age has something to do with it. </p>
            <p>The Dutch population, and Europe's population overall, is old.
                An abundance of older people takes the
                energy and velocity out of a
                society. I'm not the youngest myself anymore, and soon will be part of the problem. That doesn't take
                away that I
                would like to live in an environment which exudes energy.</p>
            <p>This was also a problem when we lived in a popular tourist
                destination like Phuket. They are full of old people. It's not their fault obviously, but the skewing
                demographics are not a good thing.
            </p>
            <p>Moving back to Thailand won't solve this, as this is a global problem and most of Asia suffers from the
                same.
            </p>
            <p>Developing countries like India, the Philippines or most of
                Africa
                are where the societies are vibrant with young energy, who have hopes and dreams, who want to build and
                create, who want to change things and make a difference. </p>

            <!-- <p>A symptom of this in Europe is that we try so hard to focus on keeping the status quo:
            </p>
            <p>Less energy, less travel, less food waste, ...</p>
            <p>We celebrate
                people who use as little energy as possible, who don't use a water cooker, who suffer through the heat
                rather than using the AC.[1]</p>
            <p>We shouldn't!</p>
            <p>We have only one path forward: to create more abundance, for everyone. The alternative is standing still,
                which means a life of
                decay. </p>
            <p>To create abundance, <b>we need to believe in more energy, more travel, more diversity, more
                    innovation.</b> We need that ambition to believe we can do it all.
            </p>

            <p><b>Finding a community of like-minded people</b></p>

            <p> One of the strongest driver of deciding where to
                live should be where we find young couples like us, with kids the same age. Pockets like this exist,
                also in the Netherlands. Though I guess they become scarcer.
            </p>

            <p>Moving to a young country could help this, and might solve something related: finding like-minded people.
                Foreigners living abroad are
                there with a purpose, not by coincidence, they tend to have better stories. From all the criteria in
                this list, <b>people and community are probably the most important</b>.</p>

            <h2>Life is easy when it's 30 degrees every day</h2>

            <p>I don't know how better to express this, but life was EASY when it was thirty degrees every day. </p>
            <p>I walked
                outside, I jumped on the
                bicycle or motorbike, the kids played outside. </p>
            <p> <b>People were more enthusiastic. </b>Image being
                spontaneous and enthusiastic when you're huddled into your collar against darkness, wind, rain
                and cold. I tried it and it takes an active effort to walk upright when the whether is bad.
            </p>
            <p>But... </p>
            <p>At least 4-5 months out of the year Thailand was too hot for me. My wife will disagree, but
                the
                warm
                season, when the sun burns vertical on my head, is
                unbearable for me. Climate change will probably exacerbate this. Once again, I have little hope for the
                near future.</p>

            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>Bangkok is a great city, but we left because every year there is smog from January to April. Which we
                could cope with, but not our newborn daughter.</p>
            <p>

                More importantly, I have no hope that Thailand will
                be able to solve this, as this is a regional problem. </p>
            <p>Then we moved to Phuket. Which is a great place. And many people started to realise this. And the local
                government
                welcomes them all, because they see dollar signs. But there is no vision for the future, no plan for the
                roads, the
                water, or any type of public transport.</p>
            <p> And hence, Phuket is gridlocked, short on water, and polluted. And again, I have very little
                confidence
                they can solve this. There is no hope, it will only get worse in the next 5 - 10 years. </p>
            <p>So we won't go back to Thailand.</p>
            <p>But we wont't stay in Amsterdam either.</p>
            <p>The Netherlands feels familiar,
                while
                Thailand was a foreign country.</p>
            <p>And that foreign country comes with something special: The sense of feeling abroad, the feeling off
                <b>adventure</b>.
            </p>


            <p><b>An optimistic community, a higher temperature, and a
                    sense of
                    adventure.</b></p>
            <p>That's what I will be looking for in the next 12 months.</p>

            <h2>Appendix: Where to Go</h2>
            <p>
                The perfect location doesn't exist, but the places below are on my radar. This list changes every
                month,
                but I feel I have to write it down somewhere.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Sydney</b> and <b>Cape Town</b> are early cities. I love early cities. Try getting a coffee
                    in
                    Amsterdam before
                    9am. Sydney is too far though. Cape Town is more realistic.
                </li>
                <li>I've never been, but <b>Curacao</b> sounds great. Overall the Caribbean sounds great. Though
                    most
                    islands
                    seem to be inhabited by old rich people.</li>
                <li><b>Cambodia</b>: because the population is young. It's corrupt as hell though</li>
                <li><b>India</b>: because that's the real remaining frontier I guess. And it's young and dynamic.
                    And
                    it's
                    growing, it's an interesting bet on the future.</li>
                <li><b>Costa Rica</b>: just because ...</li>
                <li><b>Kuala Lumpur</b>: more green and clean than Bangkok, more modern, less touristy. </li>
                <li><b>Taiwan</b>: Efficient society with relatively good weather. A society under threat performs
                    better.
                </li>
            </ul>
