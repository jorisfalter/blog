            <h1>Amsterdam Vs Thailand</h1>

            <p>We live in the Amsterdam suburbs since almost a year now, after 5 years in Bangkok and one year in
                Phuket.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Every couple of days a thought comes up of what I like and dislike.</p>

            <p>This article is to keep track of these, to help make choices in the future.</p>

            <p>Because we do know, that Amsterdam isn’t our final destination...</p>



            <h2>The Dutch Infrastructure is Great</h2>

            <p>I love infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>The Dutch infrastructure is amazing: the bicycles paths are the eight world wonder, safe
                and convenient, there is no comparison in the world;
                <br>The highways and public roads are in perfect shape and continuously improved.
            </p>
            <p>Trains and buses go at high frequency. They're probably less punctual than the Swiss or the
                Japanese, but because the high frequency that doesn't matter that much. The bus lanes and train routes
                are optimised for speed and continuously improved.</p>
            <h2>Hope as a key variable</h2>
            <p>This is a common thread for me: <i>continuous improved</i>, in the Netherlands - at least for
                infrastructure - there is hope on improvement if something is wrong today.</p>
            <p>We had a little sand path in front of our house which people used as a shortcut. I mailed the community
                and they made it into a paved path. When things can be improved, it generally will be done.</p>

            <p> Public playgrounds are ubiquitious and challenging, for our kids, and at moments even for me!
            </p>

            <p>Despite the great infrastructure, and despite the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken window theory</a>, there is
                more trash around than I
                would expect, in playgrounds, trains, buses
                and public spaces overall.
                In some parts of Asia, eating and drinking on public transport is prohibited, it keeps at least trains
                and
                buses spotless. <br>The real problem lies deeper.
            </p>
            <h2>There is no Optimism</h2>
            <p>Remember what I said about improving infrastructure? There is hope in the Dutch infrastructure. Less so
                elsewhere in society, I wonder
                if people have no hope in Europe, and hence trash everything. There is an overall
                lack of
                optimism. Sometimes even apathy. </p>
            <p>People don't smile easily here. Worse, people seem to be afraid of each other. Smiling to a stranger
                feels
                inappropriate. Let alone talking to a stranger.
            </p>
            <p>There are some real problems, like a lack of affordable housing, which probably kills hope. <br>I believe
                age
                also has something to do with it. The Dutch population, and Europe's population overall, is old.
                An abundance of older people takes the
                life out of a
                society. I'm well
                aware I'm not the youngest myself anymore, and soon will be part of the problem. Until that point, I
                would like to live in an environment which exudes energy.</p>
            <p>This was also a problem when we lived in popular tourist
                destination like Phuket. They are full of old people. It's not their fault obviously, but the skewing
                demographics are not a good thing.
            </p>
            <p> <b>One of the strongest driver of deciding where to
                    live should be where we find young couples like us, with kids the same age.</b> Neighborhoods full
                of kids exist in the Netherlands, but they are pockets. We live in a rather older neighborhood I feel.
            </p>
            <p>Moving to Asia won't solve this, as this is a global problem. Developing countries like India or most of
                Africa
                are the only ones with a young population. </p>
            <p>Moving somewhere will solve something else: finding like-minded people. Foreigners living abroad are
                there with a purpose, not by coincidence, they tend to have better stories. From all the criteria in
                this list, <b>people and community are among the most important</b>.</p>
            <h2>Life is easy when it's 30 degrees every day</h2>

            <p>I don't know how better to express this, but life was EASY when it was thirty degrees every day. I walked
                outside and jumped on the
                bicycle or motorbike, the kids played outside. </p>
            <p> <b>People were more enthusiastic. </b>Image being
                spontaneous and enthusiastic when you're huddled into your collar against darkness, wind, rain
                and cold. I tried it and it takes an active effort to walk upright when the whether is bad.
            </p>
            <p>But... <br>for me it was too hot, at least 4-5 months out of the year. My wife will disagree, but the
                warm
                season, when the sun burns vertical on my head, is
                unbearable for me. Climate change will probably exacerbate this.</p>
            <h2>We Are Scoring Own Goals in Europe</h2>
            <p>Europeans like to bitch, as I'm doing in this article.</p>
            <p>We try so hard to focus on consuming less: </p>
            <p>Less energy, less travel, less food waste, ...</p>
            <p>We celebrate
                people who use as little energy as possible, who don't use a water cooker, who suffer through the heat
                rather than using the AC.[1]</p>
            <p>We shouldn't!</p>
            <p>We have only one path forward: to create more abundance, for everyone. The alternative is standing still,
                which means a life of
                decay. </p>
            <p>To create abundance, <b>we need to believe in more energy, more travel, more diversity, more
                    innovation.</b> We need that ambition to believe we can do it all.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Amsterdam is not forever</h2>
            <p>Bangkok is a great city, but we left because when we had children, 4 months of yearly recurring air
                pollution was too much. But more importantly, there is no hope it will be solved. </p>
            <p>Then we moved to Phuket. Which is a great place. And many people realised this. And the local government
                welcomes them all, because they see dollar signs. But there is no vision or plan for the infrastructure.
                And hence, the traffic is absolutely terrible. And again, there is no hope. It will only get worse in
                the next 5 - 10 years. </p>
            <p>My wife is Dutch, I’m Dutch-speaking Belgian. The Netherlands feel familiar,
                while
                Thailand was a foreign country</p>
            <p>I miss the sense of feeling abroad, feeling the adventure.</p>
            <p><b>I guess that finished the top three criteria: a sense of hope, an optimistic community, and a sense of
                    adventure.</b></p>

            <h2>Appendix: Where to Go</h2>
            <p>
                The perfect location doesn't exist, but the places below are on my radar. This list changes every month,
                but I feel I have to write it down somewhere.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Sydney</b> and <b>Cape Town</b> are early cities. I love early cities. Try getting a coffee in
                    Amsterdam before
                    9am. Sydney is too far though. Cape Town is more realistic.
                </li>
                <li>I've never been, but <b>Curacao</b> sounds great. Overall the Caribbean sounds great. Though most
                    islands
                    seem to be inhabited by old rich people.</li>
                <li><b>Cambodia</b>: because the population is young. It's corrupt as hell though</li>
                <li><b>India</b>: because that's the real remaining frontier I guess. And it's young and dynamic. And
                    it's
                    growing, it's an interesting bet on the future.</li>
                <li><b>Costa Rica</b>: just because ...</li>
                <li><b>Kuala Lumpur</b>: more green and clean than Bangkok, more modern, less touristy. </li>
                <li><b>Taiwan</b>: Efficient society with relatively good weather. A society under threat performs
                    better.
                </li>
            </ul>
