        <h1>Privacy Policy for Link Summary</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: <strong>[Insert Date]</strong></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>Link Summary</strong> ("the Extension") is designed to enhance your browsing experience by allowing
            you to generate summaries of articles and webpage content through the OpenAI API. We are committed to
            protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we handle your data.</p>

        <h2>What Data Do We Collect?</h2>
        <p>The Extension does not collect, store, or share any personal data. However, it may interact with external
            services and APIs as part of its functionality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Key Storage:</strong> The Extension uses Chrome's <code>storage.local</code> feature to
                securely store your OpenAI API key. This key is provided by you and is only accessible within the
                Extension to facilitate API requests.</li>
            <li><strong>URL Processing:</strong> The Extension processes the URL of the webpage or link you want to
                summarize. These URLs are temporarily sent to the OpenAI API to generate summaries. The URLs are not
                stored or shared by the Extension.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Is Your Data Used?</h2>
        <p>The Extension uses the data you provide solely for its intended purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Key:</strong> The OpenAI API key is used to authenticate requests to OpenAI's servers. The
                key is not shared outside of the Extension or stored on any external server.</li>
            <li><strong>Webpage URLs:</strong> URLs are sent to OpenAI's API to generate content summaries. These URLs
                are not logged or stored by the Extension after the API call.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Do We Share Your Data?</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, share, or disclose your data to any third parties. However, data such as webpage URLs are
            sent to the OpenAI API for processing, as this is necessary for the functionality of the Extension. Please
            refer to <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a>
            for details on how they handle your data.</p>

        <h2>How Is Your Data Secured?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The OpenAI API key is securely stored using Chrome's
                <code>storage.local</code> API. This ensures that the key is isolated to your browser and is not
                accessible by other websites or extensions.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure API Requests:</strong> All requests to the OpenAI API are encrypted using HTTPS to ensure
                the security of your data in transit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
        <p>To ensure the safe usage of the Extension:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not share your OpenAI API key with others.</li>
            <li>Use the Extension responsibly and avoid summarizing sensitive or private content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>You can manage your OpenAI API key through the Extension's settings. At any time, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the stored API key via the Chrome extension settings or options page.</li>
            <li>Uninstall the Extension to remove all stored data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other
            operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When changes occur, the updated Privacy Policy will be made
            available via the Extension’s listing in the Chrome Web Store.</p>
