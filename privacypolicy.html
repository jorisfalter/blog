        <h1>Privacy Policy for Link Summary</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: <strong>[Insert Date]</strong></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>Link Summary</strong> ("the Extension") is designed to enhance your browsing experience by allowing
            you to generate summaries of articles and webpage content through the OpenAI API. We are committed to
            protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we handle your data.</p>

        <h2>What Data Do We Collect?</h2>
        <p>The Extension does not collect, store, or share any personal data. However, it may interact with external
            services and APIs as part of its functionality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenAI API Key:</strong> The Extension uses a developer-provided OpenAI API key embedded in the
                code. This key is used only to authenticate requests to OpenAI’s servers and is not accessible to users
                or third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>URL Processing:</strong> The Extension processes the URL of the webpage or link you want to
                summarize. These URLs are temporarily sent to the OpenAI API to generate summaries. The URLs are not
                stored or shared by the Extension.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Is Your Data Used?</h2>
        <p>The Extension uses the data solely for its intended purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Key:</strong> The developer-provided OpenAI API key is used to authenticate requests to
                OpenAI's servers. It is securely included within the Extension and not accessible to users or other
                parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Webpage URLs:</strong> URLs are sent to OpenAI's API to generate content summaries. These URLs
                are not logged or stored by the Extension after the API call.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Do We Share Your Data?</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, share, or disclose your data to any third parties. However, data such as webpage URLs are
            sent to the OpenAI API for processing, as this is necessary for the functionality of the Extension. Please
            refer to <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a>
            for details on how they handle your data.</p>

        <h2>How Is Your Data Secured?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Key Security:</strong> The developer-provided OpenAI API key is securely embedded in the
                Extension and not exposed to users or third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure API Requests:</strong> All requests to the OpenAI API are encrypted using HTTPS to ensure
                the security of your data in transit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
        <p>To ensure the safe usage of the Extension:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Extension responsibly and avoid summarizing sensitive or private content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>Since the OpenAI API key is provided by the developer, there are no user-configurable settings for the API
            key. If you wish to stop using the Extension, you can uninstall it at any time, which removes all associated
            functionality.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other
            operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When changes occur, the updated Privacy Policy will be made
            available via the Extension’s listing in the Chrome Web Store.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the Extension’s data practices, please
            contact us at: <strong>joris at jorisfalter dot com</strong></p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy ensures transparency and outlines the data practices of <strong>Link Summary</strong>. By
            using the Extension, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Your data is handled responsibly and
            securely, with a focus on privacy and user control.</p>
