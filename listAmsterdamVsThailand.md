Unsorted list of Pros and Cons in Thailand vs Europe

Europe / Netherlands Pro:
-regulation on airline delays. The amount of times Asian airlines give you the proverbial finger
-2 years of guarantee on electronics. The amount of chinese garbage in Thailand ...
-No borders and single currency. Currency isn't the worst, but passing immigration every time is a pain in the ass easily adding 1-2 hours.
-Attempts to recycle - and thrift stores!
-Bicycle paths (in the Netherlands)
-Public transport

Europe Con:
-Median Age is way to high (studies show GDP growth declines after median age is above 38 years old)

Thailand Pro:
-people smile (I think people in Europe feel obliged to look unhappy and frustrated )
-all beaches are public (shame on you Italy)
-extremely safe: people wear expensive jewelry and bags on the street and NO-ONE gets robbed
-I wanted to write Roaming costs in the Pro Europe - but frankly Thai carriers are cheaper, and have easy foreign bundles
-They don't take stuff that seriously, they communicate in stickers on Line (the local Whatsapp)
-People are building in Thailand - a lot, people are optimistic.
-I loved working from Starbucks: great AC and friendly baristas

Thailand Con:
-Advertising everywhere: in the metro, in the elevator, billboards, on the metro stations, often with sound
-Car obsessed
-Focused on (cheap) Mass Tourism
-Refugee center of the world (Russia, Israel, China to a certain extent)

_12 May 2025_

For almost a year we live in the Amsterdam suburbs now, after 5 years in Bangkok and one year in Phuket.

My wife is Dutch, I'm a Dutch-speaking Belgian. So the Netherlands feel close to a native country, while in Thailand we were real foreigners.

Every couple of days a thought comes up of what I like here and disliked in Thailand, or vice versa.

I tried to keep track of these, and put them in a long list.

In the end it should help us make better choices for the future.

Because we do know, that Amsterdam isn't our final destination.

## Amsterdam Pro

Let's start with the good in the Netherlands:

I love infrastructure, and for that the Netherlands is amazing. The public transport is not Swiss or Japanese, but it's close. The bicycles paths are the eight world wonder. No country is probably as safe and convenient to ride a bicycle. The highways and public roads are in perfect shape and continuously improved.

The public playgrounds for our 1 and 3 year old are amazing as well.

Counterside is that a small part of the population seems to enjoy trashing playgrounds, trains and buses and overall public spaces (we'll come back to this). Eating and drinking should probably be illegal on public transport like in some places in Asia.

## Amsterdam Con

An overall lack of optimism. Sometimes even apathy. Sometimes I wonder if people have no hope in Europe. Especially young people. People feel they have a 100 reasons to be fearful, so they don't smile.

## Thailand (Phuket / Bangkok) Pro

I don't know how better to express this, but life is EASY when it's warm. I walk outside and jump on the bicycle or motorbike, the kids play outside, the people are more enthusiastic. It seems very different to be spontaneous and enthusiastic when you're huddled into your collar against darkness, wind, rain and cold. I tried it and it takes an active effort to walk upright when the whether is bad.

## Thailand (Phuket / Bangkok) Con

It's too hot. My wife will disagree, but the warm season, when the sun burns vertical on my head, it's unbearable for me. This will get worse with climate change probably.
