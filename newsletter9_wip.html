            <h1>Newsletter #9: ...</h1>

            <!-- disclaimer -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height:15px"><i>This newsletter was originally published on the Revue
                    platform, which Twitter
                    (now X) killed after
                    being taken over by Elon Musk. I now republish it here. My latest newsletters are on <a
                        href="https://jorisfalter.ck.page/profile">Convertkit</a>.</i></p>

            <!-- newsletter content -->
            <p>
                I have been working on 3 different projects.</p>
            <p>
                I’ve also been upskilling on my NodeJS skills.</p>
            <p>

                I’m building for fun. Stuff I love, stuff I’m passionate about. To see what I gravitate towards.</p>
            <p>

                For the same incentives I’m writing this newsletter.</p>
            <p>
                To build a habit of writing.</p>
            <p></p>
            To document my progress for later when I’m a billionaire and they want to write my book.</p>
            <p>
                To preserve my learning and perspective at the specific time of my journey.</p>
            <p>

                So I’m building:</p>
            <p>
                (1) A matching engine to find flights for a weekend away
                (2) A random airport game inspired by randomstreetview
                (3) A plugin to find when train tickets are available

                I guess I’m gravitating towards travel :)

                At a certain point, I will have to adopt a commercial mindset, building products which add value to
                customers.

                I could become a freelancer, see which specific problems want solved on a recurring basis, build a
                solution
                for that launching me as an entrepreneur eventually leading to the aforementioned billions.

                But let’s not get ahead of myself.

                And keep focussing on the fun and the learning for now!

                Until then, I wish you a great remainder of the week, and a fantastic weekend!
            </p>
