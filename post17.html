      <h1>Your Job Is Safe</h1>

      <p>I recently had to do an integration between a Chinese robot and a fleet management platform.</p>

      <p>There was some time pressure so I vibe coded part of it: I shared the pdfs and links to the documentation of
        both platforms to Cursor and
        Chatgpt and told them to figure it out.</p>

      <h2>Big Mistake</h2>

      <p>I spent 10+ hours trial and erroring, clicking <em>run</em> in Cursor or saying <em>yes</em> when it suggested
        changes.
        Without
        understanding what it was doing.</p>

      <p>Turns out, Cursor didn't know what it was doing as well.</p>

      <p>The documentation and instructions were quite poor, for both platforms, and it turns out that the adagio
        <em>garbage in garbage out</em> also applies to LLMs.
      </p>

      <p>But I didn't know that at the time.</p>

      <p>Desperate I continued clicking.</p>

      <p>Intimidated by the time pressure, and the size of the code base.</p>

      <p>Slowly I developed a 6th sense, when the LLM was trying to bullshit its way through, and leading me down
        irrelevant paths.</p>

      <p>In the beginning it only dawned on me after I pressed <em>accept</em> in cursor, but I learned to recognise it
        earlier
        and earlier.</p>

      <p>This isn't a call to write bad documentation (though there will always be bad documentation, just like there
        will always be bad companies).</p>

      <p>It's a call to use LLMs in a smart way. They can help understand codebases faster, they can help figure out
        documentation faster, and sometimes, just sometimes the shortcut works and it wings it.</p>

      <p>But sometimes not.</p>

      <p>Now I have half-ass code, half of which I understand, the majority of which I don't.</p>

      <p>And that would be ok if this was the end. But I have to keep building on it.</p>

      <p>And with every new step I have to implement, I realise how poorly I understand what it does, and how I need to
        spend extra time understanding where I'm at.</p>

      <p>And while I let the LLM guide me, I don't let it steer me.</p>

      <p>It's different for mainstream tools like AWS, or landing pages. There is so much documentation there that LLMs
        know what to do.</p>

      <p>But if there is little documentation, the LLM is as clueless as me. With the difference that he doesn't admit
        it.
      </p>

      <p>Maybe our task as humans isn't to code anymore. Maybe our task is to build an architecture, a list of
        functionalities, a list of api calls, ... and write that down in a well-structured document.</p>

      <p>And from there, we can let the LLMs run with it.</p>

      <p>Writing your ideas down, and someone else executes them. Isn't that what we all want?</p>

      <p>Despite all the layoffs currently ongoing, I believe your job as a developer is still safe!</p>
