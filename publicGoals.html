      <h1>Principles</h1>



      <p>How would my 100 year old self look back on my decisions?</p>

      <p>What would he like my principles to be, for the rest of my life?</p>

      <p>My grandfather died saying he had a fantastic life. I want to look back when I’m about to die and tell my
        grandchildren I
        had a fantastic life. </p>

      <p>So what is a fantastic life?</p>
      <p><i>A fantastic life is one that brings me closer to my goals, and helps me live
          according to my principles.</i> </p>
      <p>The <i>Goals</i> are what you're reading below.</p>
      <p>The <i>Principles</i> are <a href="publicAlchemy.html">here</a>.</p>
      <br>

      <p></p>

      <!-- 

      Joris had een fantastische relatie met Marjon, kinderen, familie.- Joris nam Marjon mee op een fantastisch
      avontuur, dat startte in Bangkok en ons naar vele fantastische plaatsen bracht
      
      Joris en Marjon hadden een healthy, happy life. Mentaal en fysiek. Full of fulfilment
      Living in a peak state

        Joris took his family on a fantastic adventure, from Vilvoorde, Amersfoort, Roosendaal, Bangkok, Phuket, to many fantastic places in the world.  
  

 -->



      <p>(1) At the end of the line, Joris can say he had a fantastic life, because he made each and every day into a
        fantastic day. A fantastic day is a day which brings him closer to his goals.
      </p>

      <p><i>(2) coming soon</i></p>

      <p>(3) Build an online business. Focus on helping people. Re-invest in an offline business, a lifestyle business
        embracing fun and adventure, or a technology business.</p>

      <p>(4) Surround ourselves with great people. </p>

      <p>(5) Joris left the world a place every day, by small like things like putting a smile on someone's face, or big
        things like helping adults or children to read or to program. I want to reach 1 billion people to
        leave the world a better place every day.</p>

      <p>(6) 2 million euros should be sufficient to lead a comfortable life!
      </p>

      <p>(7) Fit and healthy: kitesurfing, running, sailing, horseback riding, white water kayaking, skiing, ... and
        physical challenges, for example skiing the Haute Route.</p>

      <p>(8) Published a semi-biographical novel</p>

      <p>(9) A nomadic lifestyle, moving to a new, adventureous place every 3 to 5 years, while keeping a simple,
        thoughtful base place to live in Europe.</p>

      <p>(10) A lifestyle brand, like fashion or hospitality or travel, travelling around the globe with my family for
        our brands.</p>
