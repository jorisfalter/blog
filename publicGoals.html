      <h1>Goals</h1>



      <p>How would my 100 year old self look back on my decisions?</p>

      <p>What would he like my principles to be, for the rest of my life?</p>

      <p>My grandfather died saying he had a fantastic life. I want to look back when I’m about to die and tell my
        grandchildren I
        had a fantastic life. </p>

      <p>So what is a fantastic life?</p>
      <p><i>A fantastic life is one that brings me closer to my goals, and helps me live
          according to my principles.</i> </p>
      <p>The <i>Goals</i> are what you're reading below.</p>
      <p>The <i>Principles</i> are <a href="publicAlchemy.html">here</a>.</p>
      <br>

      <p></p>


      <h2>List of 10 goals:</h2>

      <p>(1) At the end of the line, I can say we had a fantastic life, because we made each and every day into a
        fantastic day. A fantastic day is a day which brings us closer to our goals. A fantastic life is one full of
        fulfilment, living in a peak state.
      </p>

      <p>(2) We are a great family. If anything is worth to be the 1% off, it's probably to be in the 1% greatest
        families. Children can be challenging, but ours put us on a fantastic journey. Babies are fantastic.
        Fatherhood is amazing. New adventure arises everywhere. We will launch a fantastic family business.
      </p>

      <p>(3) We will build an online business, focused on helping people, and re-invest in an offline business, a
        lifestyle or technology business embracing fun and adventure. A lifestyle brand, like fashion or
        hospitality or travel. </p>

      <p>(4) We surround ourselves with great friends, great people and great mentors. In our professional and personal
        lives.</p>

      <p>(5) I leave the world a place every day, by small like things like putting a smile on someone's face, or big
        things like helping adults or children to read or to program. I want to reach 1 billion people to
        leave the world a better place.</p>

      <p>(6) 2 million euros should be sufficient to lead a comfortable life! Anything more is great to make a massive
        impact to improve the world.</p>

      <p>(7) A Fit and healthy life: kitesurfing, running, sailing, horseback riding, white water kayaking, skiing, ...
        and
        physical challenges, for example skiing the Haute Route.</p>

      <p>(8) I will publish a semi-biographical novel. Semi-biographical because you have to salt it a little to
        keep it interesting ;) </p>

      <p>(9) A nomadic lifestyle, moving to a new, adventureous place every 3 to 5 years, while keeping a simple,
        thoughtful base place to live in Europe. Travelling around the globe with my family for our brands.</p>

      <p>(10) We are forever young!</p>
