      <h1>Principles</h1>



      <p>How would my 100 year old self look back on my decisions?</p>

      <p>What would he like my principles to be, for the rest of my life?</p>

      <p>My grandfather died saying he had a fantastic life. I want to look back when I’m about to die and tell my
        grandchildren I
        had a fantastic life. </p>

      <p>So what is a fantastic life?</p>
      <p><i>A fantastic life is one that brings me closer to my goals, and helps me live
          according to my principles.</i> </p>
      <p>The <i>Goals</i> are what you're reading below.</p>
      <p>The <i>Principles</i> are <a href="publicAlchemy.html">here</a>.</p>
