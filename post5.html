      <h1>Why Work and Life should be not too damn serious!</h1>
      <p>In his foreword for the <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/">Navalmanack</a>, Tim Ferriss <a
          href="https://twitter.com/TFERRISS"><i class='fa fa-twitter'></i></a> describes Naval Ravikant
        <a href="https://twitter.com/naval"><i class='fa fa-twitter'></i></a> as someone who <i>doesn't take himself too
          damn seriously</i>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>I believe that's an attitude we can all use, both in life and in work.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Hence a list of things which are <i>not too damn serious</i>:</p>

      <h2>Intended as fun</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Early 2021, the Reddit Wallstreetbets group <a
            href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/25/investing/gamestop-stock-reddit-wsb/index.html"> decided to make
            fun of companies short-selling, by pumping the price of specific stocks to a tenfold and more</a>.
        <li>Around the same time <a
            href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-jumps-as-retail-investors-move-to-crypto">
            Reddit users started to pump Dogecoin.</a>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI">A landmark video</a>, DollarShaveClub definitely
          launched not too damn serious
        <li>Your boss should be fun. I was some of mine were and are!
        <li>In 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRS_Sir_David_Attenborough#Naming_poll">the British Natural
            Environment Research Council launched a poll to name their new boat</a>, the poll got hijacked by a radio
          station, resulting in a not too damn serious name!
        <li>In Montreux, Switzerland, Nestle put a <a
            href="https://www.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/vevey/the-fork-29887780/"> big fork in the lake</a>. This
          could be improved upon. Brussels could put a big Brussels Sprout on their central square. Rome a massive
          pizza.
        <li>Elon Musk build the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">CyberTruck</a>. Elon in general <a
            href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42992143">doesn't</a> take <a
            href="https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/dishy-mcflatface">himself</a> too damn serious.
        <li>When Product Hunt gives an error page, you can choose to <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@syswarren">
            see just more pets</a>
        <li><a href="https://liquiddeath.com/">Liquid Death</a> is fun!</li>
        <li><a href="https://hackertyper.net/">Hacker Typer</a> is fun</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.goatsimulator3.com/">Goat Simulator</a> is fun</li>

          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daihatsu_Wake">Boxy Kei Cars</a> are
            fun
        </ul>
