      <h1>Scam Attempt</h1>

      <p>I applied for a good project on Upwork - too good to be true in hindsight:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High pay, up to 85 dollars per hour</li>
        <li>Remote</li>
        <li>Long term project, multiple years</li>
        <li>More than 30 hours per week</li>
      </ul>

      <p>They were smart, pretending to be Japanese, so the English jobdescription wasn't written very good and very
        concise.</p>

      <p>The interview was via chat, which made sense given their poor English skills</p>

      <p>And then they asked to look at their website and they send me a repo to pull and install.</p>

      <p>I don't know what triggered my suspicion...?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I recently saw a post about someone having to install a malicious package for a project pitch</li>
        <li>Maybe my guardian angel</li>
        <li>Maybe my general scepsis which is easily triggered</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But when I saw the repo, I felt something is off</p>

      <p>And when I asked Chatgpt to look at the package.json, and it came back with an unknown package, I was pretty
        sure I was being scammed.</p>

      <p>I could have stopped there and then, but my curiosity was aroused.</p>

      <p>It turned out <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-ultra">this package</a>
        was created 2 days ago, by someone with an email without any identifiers (duhabunevoy627).</p>

      <p>I asked Cursor to create a safe Docker setup and had a look.</p>

      <p>It contained an Index.js file, which looked clean, but which had a hidden line 188 with a lot of indentations,
        and started with some kind of encryption code:</p>

      <code>global['!']='4';var _$_1e42=(function(l,e){var h=l.length;var g=[];for(var j=0;j< h;j++){g[j]= l.charAt(</code>

      <p>That was enough for me, it was exciting to understand what was happening, and I learned a lot.
      </p>
      <p> I reported to NPM, I reported to Upwork.</p>
