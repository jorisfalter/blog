      <h1>Disrupting Air Conditioning</h1>
      <p>Living in Thailand, Air Conditioning is part of daily life.</p>
      <p>In Bangkok temperatures typically hover around 30 degrees with above 50% humidity. </p>
      <p>But we love the outdoors. </p>
      <p>We keep windows open and depend on natural breeze and ceiling fans to provide coolness.</p>
      <p>This works up to a certain extent. On windless days, it becomes hot fast. And despite the ceiling fans,
        humidity makes you feel sticky. </p>
      <p>When you switch to AC, you break with outdoor life. Close windows and doors. Replace noises from the street
        outside with noises from flowing air. </p>
      <p>It changes the dynamic. </p>

          Richard Branson already launched an AC challenge </a>(Though by now removed from his blog).</p>
      <p>Here are two ideas:</p>
      <p>1) Instead of ceiling fans, mimic natural ventilation by putting a large fan on one side of your house (next to
        a window), which creates an airflow through the house</p>
      <p>2) Design new houses with chimneys, this creates a natural airflow. </p>
