            <h1>List of Zeros To Ones</h1>

            <p> I will never feel so excited and energised as when I did something for the first time</p>
            <p> so I have to extend
                my
                borders over and over again to remain challenged and exited.</p>
            <p> Now when looking back on those first
                experiences, it reminds me how far I've come.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>When Dieter handed me the controls of the Cessna Plane for the first time, somewhere in 2022 or
                    2023,
                    it's like controlling a
                    motorcycle in 6 dimensions. I felt extremely vulnerable in that small, fragile plane.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The first time sitting in an ice-bath, also somewhere in 2022 or 2023. It's a completely new
                    sensation.
                </li><br>
                <li>The first time canter on a hourse, it's a sensation going through me, it's like being Maximus
                    driving
                    the horse in Gladiator. (Somewhere in 2022, or 2023).</li><br>
                <li>The first time pitching my product to an audience, it was infused water at Proseed in 2021. I had no
                    idea what to expect but it thought me that even if your idea isn't picked up, people are interested
                    in
                    hearing your story during the drinks afterwards.</li><br>
                <li>White Water Kayaking is one of those sports which puts me in a new challenge every major rapid.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The first time giving a Toastmasters speech.</li><br>
                <li>I was nervous the first time I put an assignment on Upwork, and let someone do the work for me.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The first tweet</li><br>
                <li>The first time launching a product on ProductHunt or launching something on Hacker News</li><br>
                <li>First time doing sales calls in 2020. These calls can create highs and lows beyond imagination.
                    Sales
                    can be addictive. </li><br>
                <li>First time jumping out of plane, in a duo-jump, in 2017 or 2018.</li><br>
                <li>The first time I cycled in Bangkok, I think December 2019. I felt like I was crazy. As often,
                    reality
                    proved me otherwise. </li><br>
                <li>...</li><br>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Speaking to people deserves it's own subsection. I talk about this in my <a
                    href="https://jorisfalter.ck.page/posts/newsletter-18-from-a-new-platform">newsletter</a>: There is
                literally zero downside and massive upside to speaking to people around you.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In 2008, I spoke to someone before the first class of university, he became a great friend for many
                    years afterwards.</li><br>
                <li>Somewhere in 2021 I spoke to a Norwegian guy in the co-working and he became a good friend in
                    Thailand
                    for many years after.</li><br>
                <li>Speaking to a random guy on a diving boat in 2023 inspired me to go diving in the Maldives.</li><br>
