            <h1>Newsletter #1: Writing on Mondays</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my newsletter.</p>
            <p>I promised myself I would write a newsletter every week, every Monday morning.</p>
            <p>Because Mondays are my creative days. It’s when I’m fresh, excited, energetic.</p>
            <p>And because it creates routine. Writing on the same day, the same moment, creates momentum.</p>
            <p>Finally, it makes me finish one of the hardest tasks at the start of the week, creating a strong start of
                the week.</p>
            <p>Because writing is hard. Many developers fall for this, coding is easy, but marketing is hard.</p>
            <p>For everyone who has the same problem, I recommend reading The War Of Art. A small little motivational
                book to help you write.</p>
            <p>Two things I learned:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Write for yourself, not for your audience

                <li> Even for established writers, writing is hard. It doesn’t come natural. You have to force yourself
                    by doing it.

            </ul>
            <p>So that’s what I intend to do. Today is the start of the post-summer season, September to December. And
                my goal is to write a newsletter every week until the end of the year.</p>
            <p>Wish me luck!</p>
            <p>Joris</p>
