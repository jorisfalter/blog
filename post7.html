      <h1>List of Favorite Books</h1>
      <p>The full list is on <s>Goodreads</s> <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books-read/jiros">The Story
          Graph</a>.</p>
      <p>It's so incredibly hard to make a selection. And my preferences change over time!</p>
      <br>
      <p>I dislike it when people have long lists of books. </p>
      <p>I always think: <i>they can't all be good.</i></p>
      <p>But then I made my own list, and it's true.</p>
      <p>Each one of these has had a profound impact on my life. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>1. Non Fiction</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Total Recall</h3>
      <p>You probably did something right if you were a world-champion bodybuilding, a tier 1 actor, and a governor.
      </p>
      <p>It's probably romanticed as it reads as fiction at times. Nevertheless it's a great story.</p>
      <p>It's also the first biography I ever read, and it started my interest for reading and learning through
        biographies.</p>

      <h3>1.2 Open</h3>
      <p>The most personal biography I've ever read. It made me realise even top stars doubt themselves. The only other
        book which shows this vulnerability was Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (which was never intended to be read lest
        himself).
      </p>
      <p>I hesitated to read this book as I have little affinity with tennis, but I absolutely don't regret reading it!

      <h3>1.3 The Beginning of Infinity
      </h3>

      <p> Finally an optimistic book about the future! </p>
      <img src="pics/beginningOfInfinity.jpeg" class="books-pics" alt="The Beginning of Infinity" height="300">
      <h3 id="msfm">1.4 Man's Search for Meaning</h3>
      <p>To learn the meaning of life...?</p>
      <img src="pics/msfm.jpg" class="books-pics" alt="Man's Search for Meaning" height="300">

      <h3>1.5 The Way of the Superior Man</h3>
      <p>Because life is more than work alone.</p>
      <img src="pics/superiorman.jpg" class="books-pics" alt="The Way Of The Superior Man" height="300">

      <h3>1.6 Wild Company: The Untold Story of Banana Republic</h3>
      <p>Best inspiration to start building a business with my spouse.</p>
      <img src="pics/wildCompany.jpeg" class="books-pics" alt="The Way Of The Superior Man" height="300">

      <h3>1.7 Wild Swans</h3>
      <p>More or less covers the history of China for the last 100 years through a personal story. Helped me
        understand how China became what it is today. </p>
      <img src="pics/wildswans.jpg" class="books-pics" alt="Wild Swans" height="300">
      <h3>1.8 Surely You're Joking Mister Feynmann</h3>
      <p>A masterclass in curiosity and the fruits it bears.</p>
      <img src="pics/surelyYouReJoking.jpeg" class="books-pics" alt="Surely You're Joking" height="300">


      <h3>1.8 Thinking Fast and Slow</h3>
      <p></p>
      <img src="pics/tfas.jpg" class="books-pics" alt="" height="300">

      <h3>1.9 Getting More</h3>
      <p>The first business book I read. I felt like a loser reading a book like this. But I read it over and over
        again because it was so useful in so many of life's situations.
        More than the contents from the book, it's the way it made me realise how much knowledge is available out there.
        From here I started buying more non-fiction books on any topic which interested me.</p>
      <img src="pics/gettingMore.jpeg" class="books-pics" alt="" height="300">

      <h3>1.10 How To Have A Good Day</h3>
      <p>This one I also read and listened over and over again in my early career. </p>
      <img src="pics/hthagd.jpg" class="books-pics" alt="" height="300">

      <h3>1.11 The Power of Habit</h3>
      <p>I finished this one on a day flight from New-Zealand to Bangkok. I was hesitant because of the cliche title,
        but there are some good learnings there. Habits are a very powerful things. Made me realise quitting coffee is
        hard, better to replace it with something. More books have been written on habits. Atomic Habits being the most
        recent one. I haven't read that one.</p>
      <img src="pics/powerOfHabit.jpg" class="books-pics" alt="" height="300">

      <h3>1.12 The Power Of Now</h3>
      <p>This one and the next ones are more spiritual. This one has the same style of stupid cliche title as the
        previous, but is once again a gem to understand myself.</p>
      <img src="pics/powerOfNow.pjg" class="books-pics" alt="" height="300">

      <h3>1.13 Siddharta</h3>
      <p>Leading the simple life.</p>
      <img src="pics/" class="books-pics" alt="" height="300">

      <h3>1.14 The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</h3>
      <p></p>
      <img src="pics/" class="books-pics" alt="" height="300">

      <h3>1.15 The Untethered Soul</h3>
      <p></p>
      <img src="pics/" class="books-pics" alt="" height="300">

      <h3>1.16 The Surrender Experiment</h3>
      <p>By the same writer as the previous, it's an autobiography. It helps me be more accepting of unexpected things
        which happen in my life.</p>
      <img src="pics/" class="books-pics" alt="" height="300">

      <h3>1.17 Meditations</h3>
      <p>It puts a lot of things in perspective when reading the doubts from the most powerful man in the world 2000
        years ago.</p>
      <img src="pics/" class="books-pics" alt="" height="300">

      <h2>2. Fiction<h2>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>Fiction allows to create some great, inspiring people. Sometimes I wonder how authors can create these
            characters. Are they like that themselves, they must be great people then.</p>
          <h3>2.1 The Bonfire of Vanities</h3>
          <p>So deep, so real. Not just a good guys versus bad guys story, but real people with real nuances. </p>
          <img src="pics/vreugdevuur.jpeg" class="books-pics" alt="Vreugdevuur der ijdelheden" height="300">

          <h3>2.2 The Secret History</h3>
          <p>This one strongly resonated with me when I was a student. Maybe I should re-read to remember how I feel
            about it today. Similarly to the Shadow Of The Wind it's quite a dark story if I remember correctly, and
            these days I'm more opportunistic.</p>
          <img src="pics/secretHistory.jpeg" class="books-pics" alt="Vreugdevuur der ijdelheden" height="300">

          <h3>2.3 The Shadow of the Wind</h3>
          <p>Such a magical story when I was younger, but re-reading it when I was in my thirties it resonated less.
            Maybe also because it's quite a dark story, and these days I'm more opportunistic.</p>
          <img src="pics/shadow.jpeg" class="books-pics" alt="Vreugdevuur der ijdelheden" height="300">

          <h3>2.4 A Gentleman in Moscow</h3>
          <p>A story which made me smile. The protagonist is the best most inspiring character in the world. Probably my
            favorite fiction book of all.</p>
          <img src="pics/gentlemaninmoscow.jpeg" class="books-pics" alt="Gentleman in Moscow" height="300">

          <h3>2.5 Shōgun</h3>
          <p>Rough to get through the first few chapters, but after that the characters become larger than life and
            the story full of surprises. What I really love is that some characters are just amazing, inspiring people.
          </p>
          <h3>2.6 Grand Hotel Europa </h3>
          <p>A piece of art about love, tourism, immigration, Europe, ... And on top of that it's hilarious.</p>
          <h3>2.7 Cryptonomicon</h3>
          <p>Similar to Shogun it's rough in the beginning, but it's great to read a book where all the pieces
            of the puzzle come together so magically at the end. Admittedly, it has been a very long time ago since I
            read this book.</P>
          <h3>2.8 1Q84</h3>
          <p>Yes, with a Q.</p>
          <p>Weird, but nevertheless, I couldn't put it down.</p>
          <img src="pics/1q84.jpeg" class="books-pics" alt="1Q84" height="300">
          <h3>2.9 Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</h3>
          <p>It took me until my thirties to discover this. Way too late. Great humour.</p>
          <h3>2.10 The Thousand Autums Of Jacob de Zoet</h3>
          <p>There is something profound about a book which spans a person's entire lifetime. It makes me realise my
            time here on earth is limited, and I better start to appreciate the moment more, and make sure I don't
            regret not doing anything when my time has come. </p>
          <p>Other than that also a good historical fiction book about the Dutch in Japan in the colonial times.</p>
