      <h1>List of Favorite Books</h1>
      <p>The full list is on <s>Goodreads</s> <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books-read/jiros">The Story
          Graph</a>.</p>
      <p>It's so incredibly hard to make a selection. And my preferences change over time!</p>
      <h2>1. Non Fiction</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Total Recall</h3>
      <p>You probably did something right if you were a world champion bodybuilding, a tier 1 actor, and a governor.
      </p>
      <p>It's probably romanticed as it reads as fiction at times. Nevertheless it's a great story.</p>

      <h3>1.2 Open</h3>
      <p>The most personal biography I've ever read. It made me realise even top stars doubt themselves. The only other
        book which shows this vulnerability was Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (which was never intended to be read lest
        himself).
      </p>
      <p>I hesitated to read this book as I have little affinity with tennis, but I absolutely don't regret reading it!
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 The Beginning of Infinity
      </h3>

      <p> Finally an optimistic book about the future! </p>

      <h3 id="msfm">1.4 Man's Search for Meaning</h3>
      <p>To learn the meaning of life...?</p>
      <img src="pics/msfm.jpg" alt="Man's Search for Meaning" height="300">

      <h3>1.5 The Way of the Superior Man</h3>
      <p>Because life is more than work alone.</p>
      <img src="pics/superiorman.jpg" alt="The Way Of The Superior Man" height="300">

      <h3>1.6 Wild Company: The Untold Story of Banana Republic</h3>
      <p>Best inspiration to start building a business with my spouse.</p>
      <img src="pics/wildCompany.jpeg" alt="The Way Of The Superior Man" height="300">

      <h3>1.7 Wild Swans</h3>
      <p>More or less covers the history of China for the last 100 years through a personal story. Helped me
        understand how China became what it is today. </p>
      <img src="pics/wildswans.jpg" alt="Wild Swans" height="300">
      <h3>1.8 Surely You're Joking Mister Feynmann</h3>
      <p>A masterclass in curiosity and the fruits it bears.</p>
      <img src="pics/surelyYouReJoking.jpeg" alt="Wild Swans" height="300">


      <h2>2. Fiction<h2>
          <h3>2.1 The Bonfire of Vanities</h3>
          <p>So deep, so real. Not just a good guys versus bad guys story, but real people. </p>
          <img src="pics/vreugdevuur.jpeg" alt="Vreugdevuur der ijdelheden" height="300">

          <h3>2.2 The Secret History</h3>
          <p>This one strongly resonated with me when I was a student. Maybe I should re-read to remember how I feel
            about it today. Similarly to the Shadow Of The Wind it's quite a dark story if I remember correctly, and
            these days I'm more opportunistic.</p>

          <h3>2.3 The Shadow of the Wind</h3>
          <p>Such a magical story when I was younger, but re-reading it when I was in my thirties it resonated less.
            Maybe also because it's quite a dark story, and these days I'm more opportunistic.</p>

          <h3>2.4 A Gentleman in Moscow</h3>
          <p>A story which made me smile. The protagonist is the best person in the world I'll ever meet.</p>
          <img src="pics/gentlemaninmoscow.jpeg" alt="Gentleman in Moscow" height="300">

          <h3>2.5 Shōgun</h3>
          <p>Rough to get through the first few chapters, but after that the characters become larger than life and
            the story full of surprises.</p>
          <h3>2.6 Grand Hotel Europa </h3>
          <p>A piece of art about love, tourism, immigration, Europe, ... And on top of that it's hilarious.</p>
          <h3>2.7 Cryptonomicon</h3>
          <p>Similar to Shogun it's rough in the beginning, but it's great to read a book where all the pieces
            of the puzzle come together so magically at the end.</P>
          <h3>2.8 1Q84</h3>
          <p>Yes, with a Q</p>
          <p>Weird, but nevertheless, I couldn't put it down</p>
