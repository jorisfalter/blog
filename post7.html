      <h1>List of Favorite Books</h1>
      <p>The full list is on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35770870-joris">Goodreads</a>.</p>
      <p>It's so incredibly hard to make a selection. And my preferences change over time!</p>
      <h2>1. Non Fiction</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Total Recall</h3>
      <p>You probably did something right if you were a world champion bodybuilding, a tier 1 actor, and a governor.
      </p>
      <p>It's probably romanticed as it reads as fiction at times. Nevertheless it's a great story.</p>

      <h3>1.2 Open</h3>
      <p>The most personal biography I've ever read. It made me realise even top stars doubt themselves. The only other
        book which shows this vulnerability was Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (which was never intended to be read lest
        himself).
      </p>
      <p>I hesitated to read this book as I have little affinity with tennis, but I absolutely don't regret reading it!

      <h3>1.3 The Beginning of Infinity
      </h3>

      <p> Finally an optimistic book about the future! </p>

      <h3>1.4 Man's Search for Meaning</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>1.5 The Way of the Superior Man</h3>
      <p>Because life is more than work alone.</p>
      <h3>1.6 Wild Company: The Untold Story of Banana Republic</h3>
      <p>Best inspiration if you ever want to build a business with your spouse.</p>

      <h2>2. Fiction<h2>
          <h3>2.1 The Bonfire of Vanities</h3>
          <p>So deep, so real. Not just a good guys versus bad guys story, but real people. </p>
          <h3>2.2 The Secret History</h3>
          <p>This one strongly resonated with me when I was a student. </p>
          <h3>2.3 The Shadow of the Wind</h3>
          <p>Such a magical story. Re-reading it now to find that magic again.</p>
          <h3>2.4 A Gentleman in Moscow</h3>
          <p>A story which makes you smile. The protagonist is the best person in the world you'll ever meet.</p>
          <h3>2.5 Shōgun</h3>
          <p>Rough to get through the first few chapters, but after that the characters become larger than life and
            the story full of surprises.</p>
          <h3>2.6 Grand Hotel Europa </h3>
          <p>Only in Dutch, English coming soon</p>
          <h3>2.7 Cryptonomicon</h3>
          <p>Similar to Shogun it's rough in the beginning, but it's great when you read a book and all the pieces
            of the puzzle come together so magically at the end.</P>
          <h3>2.8 1Q84</h3>
          <p>Yes, with a Q</p>
          <p>Weird, but nevertheless, I couldn't put it down</p>
          <h3>2.9 Wild Swans</h3>
          <p>If you want to understand how China became what it is today, this is a good first step</p>
