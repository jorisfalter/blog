      <p>I think it's fascinating to see people read traditional Japanese vertically in these little pocket books. </p>

      <p> I wondered if it would also look cool in English</p>

      <p>So I wrote a little App Script to try</p>

      <p> The short answer, it doesn't look cool because English words are not equal in length</p>

      <p> But I had a lot of fun trying and playing with it. I converted a famous essay into a vertical format for you
        to have a look. You have to read from top right to bottom left. Have fun!</p>
