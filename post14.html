      <p>I think it's fascinating to see people read traditional vertical Japanese. Often in these little pocket books
        on the metro or bus üìö. </p>

      <p> I wondered if it would also look cool in English ü§î.</p>

      <p> The short answer, it doesn't look cool because English words are not equal in length.</p>

          href="docs/Maker ScheduleManagerScheduleVertical.pdf">famous essay into a vertical format</a> for you
        to have a look, and I put it on my Kindle. </p>
