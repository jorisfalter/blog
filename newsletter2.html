            <!-- disclaimer -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height:15px"><i>This newsletter was originally published on the Revue
                    platform, which Twitter
                    (now X) killed after
                    being taken over by Elon Musk. I now republish it here. My latest newsletters are on <a

            <!-- newsletter content -->
            <p>I’m back in Bangkok after a mixed holiday and workation.</p>
            <p>I initially planned for 3 weeks of holidays.</p>
            <p>Then I took on a new freelance project, so 2 weeks OOO was the max.</p>
            <p> I spent the last week of my holiday working, while I was in Korea.</p>
            <p>And that was refreshing.</p>
            <p>A new environment creates so much space for new ideas, new motivation.</p>
            <p>I used my father-in-law’s motorcycle and drove around Geoje island, where, other than Koreans, not many
                foreign tourists come.</p>
            <p>No foreign tourists means no co-working spaces. And only Korean tourists means that most of the coffee
                bars
                are empty on weekdays.</p>
            <p>I worked from 6 -7 coffee shops in multiple villages, cities and next to beaches. And used the motorcycle
                to
                drive in between.</p>
            <p>It generates so much freedom, even though I’m working.</p>
            <p>What is nice is that it’s explorative. It opens my idea generating mind, my creative mind.</p>
            <p>So I decided to do the same in Bangkok. Rather than working from the same co-working every day, I will
                once
                again explore Bangkok, see it with new eyes every day.</p>
            <p> And keep my sense of wonder.</p>
            <p> It’s requires a little more work to find something new, because I’ve been around in Bangkok and I know
                most
                of the good coffee bars for working.</p>
            <p>But keeping my sense of wonder also means trying new modes of transportation (like public transport, by
                foot, or while running).</p>
            <p>The work has to be done, and idea generation is not the end of the line, sometimes you just need to go
                heads
                down and get stuff done.</p>
            <p>But for now I’m enjoying the view from the Waldorf Astoria’s coffee bar, with a beautiful scenery of the
                city’s golf terrain.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Have a great week ahead!</p>
