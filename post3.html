      <p>I wonder how organising meetings worked before online calendars were invented.</p>

      <p>I feel meetings must have been organised with mutual consent.</p>

      <p>Today the mutual consent part got lost.</p>

      <p>An open slot means you’re free.</p>

      <p>When someone invites you on that open slot, you are expected to accept the invite.</p>

      <p>Despite it shattering your day into pieces.</p>

      <br>

      <p>To prevent that, you could block your calendar upfront.</p>

      <p>Many people are reluctant to do that. I was as well.</p>

      <p>It made me feel as not cooperative.</p>

      <p>Last year I put a 3 hour focus-time block in my afternoon.</p>

      <p>I expected a backlash. It never came. And now it's a feature on Google Calendar.</p>

      <br>

      <p>The next step was dreadful same day meetings.</p>

      <p>I am a planner. </p>

      <p>At the end of every day I make my planning for the next day.</p>

      <p>I want to execute this planning.</p>

      <p>I wrote a <a href="www.samedayblocker.com">script</a> to make sure my current day is fully blocked.</p>

      <p>It runs every evening at 10pm and blocks my next day.</p>

      <p>Now when people urgently need me, they reach out, and we assess whether the problem justifies the urgency.</p>

      <p>One step closer to my holy grail: finishing my planning every day!</p>
