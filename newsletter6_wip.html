            <!-- disclaimer -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height:15px"><i>This newsletter was originally published on the Revue
                    platform, which Twitter
                    (now X) killed after
                    being taken over by Elon Musk. I now republish it here. My latest newsletters are on <a

            <!-- newsletter content -->
            <p>Last week I launched on <a
                    href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/same-day-blocker?utm_campaign=Weekly%20newsletter%20of%20Joris%20Falter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Product
                    Hunt</a> and <a
                    href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32980101&utm_campaign=Weekly%20newsletter%20of%20Joris%20Falter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Hackernews</a>.
            </p>
            <p>My expectations were low. I’ve build this a year ago, for myself, and it’s very much a niche product.</p>
            <p>So why did I post it?</p>
            <p>I realised I have to build a brand, put myself out there, become a marketeer, a sales, all together: an
                entrepreneur.</p>
            <p>Hence this newsletter</p>
            <p>Hence launching my product</p>
            <p>What I learned is that it’s addictive.</p>
            <p>Even if <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/JorisFalter/status/1575674059559292928?utm_campaign=Weekly%20newsletter%20of%20Joris%20Falter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">the
                    results aren’t that impressive</a>.</p>
            It’s addictive to put yourself out there. Get comments from real people, upvotes from people I’ve never
            heard about, getting 113 people who visited my website…
            I feel I have momentum now, and I have to keep it. Build more small projects. Launch every month.
            I already built a small app to learn Italian. But I can do better!
            And while I’m at it:
            get a mentor
            meet other builders in a local community
            take a weekend of me-time elsewhere to build build build hackathon style
            outsource more
            keep my peak energy momentum!
            With that, I wish you a peak energy week from the GetFresh in the Singha Complex BKK.
            PS My peak energy might have been a confluence of launching and listening to Tony Robbins about peak states.
            In short: When do you feel best? When you’re in a peak state obviously. So why don’t you just put yourself
            in a peak state all the time?﻿
