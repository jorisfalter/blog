            <h1>Newsletter #9: Projects Update</h1>

            <!-- disclaimer -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height:15px"><i>This newsletter was originally published on the Revue
                    platform, which Twitter
                    (now X) killed after
                    being taken over by Elon Musk. I now republish it here. My latest newsletters are on <a
                        href="https://jorisfalter.ck.page/profile">Convertkit</a>.</i></p>

            <!-- newsletter content -->
            <p>
                I have been working on 3 different projects.</p>
            <p>
                I’ve also been upskilling on my NodeJS skills.</p>
            <p>

                I’m building for <a href="https://www.jorisfalter.com/post5.html">fun</a>.
                Stuff I love, stuff I’m passionate about. To see what I gravitate towards.</p>
            <p>

                For the same incentives I’m writing this newsletter:</p>
            <p>
                To build <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/29/know-thyself-by-writing-your-first-novel">a
                    habit of writing</a>.</p>
            <p>
                To document my progress for later when I’m a billionaire and they want to write my book.</p>
            <p>
                To <a href="https://twitter.com/tdinh_me/status/1526589701863636993">preserve my learning and
                    perspective </a>at the specific time of my journey.</p>
            <p>

                So I’m building:</p>
            <p>

                (1) A matching engine to find flights for a weekend away</p>
            <p>
                (2) A random airport game inspired by <a href="https://randomstreetview.com/">randomstreetview</a></p>
            <p>
                (3) A plugin to find when train tickets are available</p>
            <p>

                I guess I’m gravitating towards travel :)</p>
            <p>

                At a certain point, I will have to adopt a commercial mindset, building products which add value to
                customers.</p>
            <p>

                I could become a freelancer, see which specific problems people want solved on a recurring basis, build
                a solution for that, which launches me as an entrepreneur, eventually leading to the aforementioned
                billions.</p>
            <p>

                But let’s not get ahead of myself.</p>
            <p>

                And keep focussing on the fun and the learning for now!</p>
            <p>

                Until then, I wish you a great remainder of the week, and a fantastic weekend!
            </p>
