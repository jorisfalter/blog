            <h1>Principles</h1>

            <p> How would my 70 year old self think about my decisions?</p>

            <p>What would he like my principles to be, for the rest of my life?</p>

            <p>My grandfather died saying he had a fantastic life. I want to look back when I’m about to die and say
                that I
                had a fantastic life. </p>

            <p>So what is a fantastic life?</p>
            <p> "A fantastic life is one that brings me closer to my goals, and helps me live
                according to my principles." </p>
            <p>Below are the principles.</p>

            <h2>Think long term</h2>

            <p> My 70 year old self wants me to play long term games, with long term people.</p>

            <p> President Zelensky asked not to have a picture of him in government buildings, classrooms, ... </p>
            <p>But instead for
                everyone to have a picture of their children. And think about them when making decisions.</p>

            <h2>Time is my most important resource in life</h2>

            <p>I don't want to waste it.</p>

            <br>

            <p>To be continued</p>
