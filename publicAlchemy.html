      <h1>Principles</h1>

      <p> How would my 100 year old self look back on my decisions?</p>

      <p>What would he like my principles to be, for the rest of my life?</p>

      <p>My grandfather died saying he had a fantastic life. I want to look back when I’m about to die and tell my
        grandchildren I
        had a fantastic life. </p>

      <p>So what is a fantastic life?</p>
      <p><i>"A fantastic life is one that brings me closer to my goals, and helps me live
          according to my principles."</i> </p>
      <p>These "principles" are what you're currently reading.</p>

      <h2>(1) Think long term</h2>

      <p> My 100 year old self wants me to invest in things with provide joy on the long term, and in people who provide
        joy on the long term.</p>

      <p> President Zelensky asked not to have a picture of him in government buildings, classrooms, but instead that
        everyone have a picture of their children on their desk. And think about them when making decisions.</p>

      <h2>(2) Time is my most important resource in life</h2>

      <p>I don't want to waste it.</p>

      <br>

      <h2>(3) A joyful life</h2>

      <p>My 100 year old self wants me to have led a joyful, energetic life, where I'm always in a peak state. That’s
        why I
        prioritise fun.</p>

      <p>I laugh violently, i make (bad) jokes,</p>

      <p>I realise some problems are massively important, but they’re easier to solve in a playful mood,</p>

      <p>I want to help people have fun. I want to make a business which is fun. That’s why I’m building in public. To
        have and ship fun!</p>

      <p>I am opportunistic - My 100 year old self doesn't want to regret not doing anything I wanted to do.</p>

      <p>I believe my mental health contributes massively to my physical health. If I am unhappy, my body
        deteriorates, so I better be joyful!</p>

      <p>I want to become financially successful as a byproduct of fun. Not the other way around.</p>

      <p> I want to see people smile as the result of an interaction with me or my products. I understand it’s
        challenging
        to see the smiles on your customers’ faces when building digital products.</p>

      <p>...</p>
      <p>To be continued</p>
