      <h1>Principles</h1>



      <p>How would my 100-year-old self look back on my life?</p>

      <p>What would he like my principles to be?</p>

      <p>My grandfather died saying he had a fantastic life. I want to tell my
        grandchildren I also had a fantastic life. </p>
      <br>
      <p>So what is a fantastic life?</p>
      <blockquote><i>A fantastic life is one that brings me closer to my goals, and in which I live
          according to my principles.</i> </blockquote>
      <p>The <i>Principles</i> are what this page is about.</p>
      <p>The <i>Goals</i> are <a href="publicGoals.html">here</a>.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>(1) I think long term. From the perspective of my 100-year-old self (or older)</h2>

      <p> My 100-year-old self wants me to invest in things and people which provide joy on the long term. My-100-year
        old self:

      <p>(1) Is fit, healthy and mentally at ease (<a href=#p10>principle 10</a>)</p>
      <p>(2) Is surrounded with great people (<a href=#p5>principle 5</a>)</p>
      <p>(3) Doesn’t depend on the government for retirement, also never retires! (<a href=#p4>principle 4</a>)</p>

      <br>



      <p>Apparently Zelensky (the Ukrainian President) once said that they shouldn't have pictures of him in government
        buildings, classrooms, and other official buildings. Everyone should have a picture of their children on their
        desk.
        And think about them when making decisions. I'm not sure if he said it, but the idea is right.
      </p>
      <p>Those are the kind of decisions I want to make.</p>
      <p>Naval is has a quite cynical <a
          href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1587278873980391426?s=46&t=LBgbE-HUzzLZn6nW4Q1_bQ">tweet about
          children</a></p>

      <p>Most of the other principles below are natural consequences of this idea.</p>

      <br>

      <br>

      <h2>(2) Time is My Most Important Resource in Life</h2>

      <p>I don't want to waste time. Ever.</p>

      <p>I will only live once, I want it to be a life worth living!</p>

      <p>I only have 100 years* to have an amazing life doing amazing things. There is a sense of urgency to get
        things done!</p>
      <p>Even if I think I have mountains of time, for almost everything, the situation can change unexpectedly at all
        times. I have to take action now.</p>
      <p>I need to run at all times, I need to have a high intensity at all times. <br><br>There are only a few moments
        when
        that's not the case: when meditating, when reading and reminiscing notes or things I wrote in my past, when
        reading fiction, when doing yoga, ... <br>I don't know how to clearly separate the high intensity / low
        intensity
        yet. </p><br>
      <p>I want to go to bed being excited for the next day. Almost as if I cannot sleep because of it. Like a
        little child who can't sleep for excitement for Santa Claus in the morning. </p>
      <p><i style="font-size: 12px;">* If no issues prematurely, if no life-extension breakthroughs, ...</i></p>



      <br>

      <h2>(3) My Life is A Joyful, Adventureous Life</h2>

      <p><b>Life is an Adventure!</b></p>

      <p>My 100-year-old self wants me to have led a joyful, energetic life. Always in a peak state. That’s
        why I prioritise fun.</p>

      <p>I laugh violently, I make jokes, often bad ones.</p>

      <p>I try to make other people smile. I try to smile a lot myself.</p>

      <p>It's easier to solve problems in a happy, playful mood.</p>

      <p>I want to help people have fun. I want to make a business which is fun.</p>

      <p>I am <b>opportunistic</b> - My 100-year-old self doesn't want to regret not doing anything I wanted to do.</p>
      <p>I want to take the most exciting option at all times, and I want to create exciting options at all times.</p>

      <p>I believe my mental health contributes massively to my physical health. If I am unhappy, my body
        deteriorates, so I better be joyful!</p>

      <p><b>I want to become financially successful as a byproduct of fun. Not the other way around.</b></p>

      <p> I want to see people smile as the result of an interaction with me or my products. That's not easy when
        building digital products, because there is no in-person transaction. That's why eventually I want to build
        an offline lifestyle business.</p>
      <p><b>I believe that with high energy and optimism I will always be able to create better opportunities to improve
          my
          life.</b></p>


      <br>
      <h2 id="p4">(4) I want to be Financially Independent</h2>

      <p>We probably need around 2 million USD if we spend 5,000 USD monthly together with my spouse after retirement.
        Assuming
        we retire at 70 and die at 100.</p>
      <p>Frankly, I never want to retire at all. Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet are prime examples. </p>
      <p>The biggest potential return is probably in starting a business.</p>
      <p>I believe the best business is the one I'm passionate about.</p>
      <p>So the path I'm following is building
        according to my gut feel until I stumble upon something that people want to pay for, while at the same time it's
        something I'm passionate about.</p>
      <p>A <i>Throw Until Something Sticks</i> approach.</p>
      <br>
      <p> Another part of growing financially independent is taking risks, and jumping on opportunities. Sometimes a
        cryptocurrency or stock rises or declines unexpectedly. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes it doesn't. But when
        it happens,
        I better be there.</p>
      <br>
      <p><a href="https://jorisfalter.ck.page/posts/newsletter-39-the-remote-life-plan">Newsletter #39 - The Remote Life
          Plan</a> elaborates on why we need to earn independent of location.</p>

      <br>
      <h2 id="p5">(5) Everything has been done before</h2>
      <p>For most things in life, there is someone who has been there before. </p>
      <p>Instead of asking what I want, I ask
        who I want to become. </p>
      <p>I admire people like Tony Robbins, Richard Branson, ... who provide strong energy while maintaining a strong
        element of fun. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>(6) I want to create opportunities through Intentional Serendipity</h2>
      <p>It's important to keep meeting people to get new ideas. </p>
      <p>I once read a story in which one person builds behinds closed doors, while the other is always chit-chatting.
        The moral was that the former gets a lot more done, and the latter gets less done overall, but what he gets done
        is a a lot more
        relevant. I believe there is truth in
        this story. </p>
      <p>I'm
        training my personality to adhere to this principle. </p>
      <p>Here's <a href="https://jorisfalter.ck.page/posts/newsletter-37-braindump">a link to my
          newsletter covering this</a>. </p>
      <p>Other people call this <i>increasing the surface area</i>.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>(7) Children Are Amazing!</h2>

      <p>It adds to Principle 3, it makes life an even bigger adventure.</p>
      <p>We thrive 10x in the chaos which two kids bring.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>(8) I train myself to be resourceful </h2>
      <p>I want to have five solutions in my head even before reaching the Google search bar.</p>
      <p>There's always a way, I just have to figure out (See <a href=#p5>principle 5</a>: Everything has been done
        before).</p>
      <br>
      <h2>(9) I want to spend time with my parents and listen to their stories</h2>
      <p>There will come a time when they are not there anymore to tell their stories.</p>
      <p>Maybe I should write their stories?</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="p10">(10) My body should be mentally and physically fit to become a 100 years old</h2>
      <p>If I want to reach the age of 100, I need to take care of my body, both physically and mentally.</p>
      <p>Physically it requires daily exercise and a healthy diet.</p>
      <p>Mentally it requires taking time off for myself. Time for meditation or priming, time for focused work. 15-30
        minutes per
        day would be ideal. A weekend per half year would be fantastic. </p>
      <p>Mentally it also requires a passion for what I do. A love and purpose. <i>He who has a Why to live for can bear
          almost any How</i> (from <a href="post7.html#msfm">Man's Search for Meaning</a>). </p>
      <br>
      <h2>(11) I want to push beyond my borders</h2>
      <p>Physically and mentally by running marathons, by doing ice baths, by doing other physical challenges like the
        Dodentocht (Death March) or the Phuket Triathlon.</p><br>
      <p> By bungee jumping in 2025. By holding a python snake in 2023.</p>
      <p>Going out of my comfort zone, doing things for the first time, provides adrenaline, a feeling of being alive.
        And joy and satisfaction in hindsight. Once the pain has passed.</p>


      <h2>(12) I want to be grateful</h2>
      <p>Gratitude is one of the strongest forces towards having a fulfilled life. We're creatures who have
        self-awareness,
        on a small spinning rock somewhere in an infinite universe, in a relative time. That in itself is a great start
        to be
        grateful!
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>(13) I want to be generous</h2>
      <p>The secret to living is giving. If at moments I feel I don't have enough, I donate to
        charity. It puts me with both feet on the ground that I have abundance.</p>
      <p>While living in Asia, I realise I'm very lucky to have been born and raised in a European country:
      <div class="sub-bullets">
        (1) Great public education (compared to Asia)<br>
        (2) In a democracy where everyone can write and say what he wants (contrary to most of South-East Asia)<br>
        (3) In a family with modest financial means (contrary to many families in Thailand, let alone Laos, Myanmar,
        Cambodja,
        ...)<br>
        (4) In a country not torn apart by civil war (present day Myanmar)<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>I try to be generous with all people who have less than me. The bigger the difference, the more generous I
        should be. Not only in money, also in words and deeds.
      </p>
      <h2>(14) I'm the one who loses if I get angry</h2>
      <p>Getting angry towards someone takes a massive amount of mental capacity, mental capacity is being burned on
        choosing arguments, making statements, and digging trenches, and afterwards a visual of the situation keeps
        replaying in my head.</p>
      <p>Paul Graham elaborates on this in <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">The Top Idea In Your Mind</a>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages. Someone who does you an injury hurts you
        twice: first by the injury itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about it. If you learn
        to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the second half. I've found I can to some extent avoid thinking about
        nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn't deserve space in my head. I'm always
        delighted to find I've forgotten the details of disputes, because that means I hadn't been thinking about them.
        My wife thinks I'm more forgiving than she is, but my motives are purely selfish.</blockquote>
      <p>Marc Benioff in his book Behind The Cloud, elaborates that he learned to keep calm at all times, when reading
        Sun Tzu's the Art of War:</p>
      <blockquote>He who is quick tempered can be insulted</blockquote>

      <h2> Public Backlog</h2>
      <div class="public-backlog">


        <p>-- If there's a reason to dress up for a party, I do it! It only has advantages: Costumes are the best,
          playing
          a
          role is great fun, it makes it easier to strike conversation, ... Also applies for suiting up for a night out!
        </p>

        <p>-- If I can make every day a great day, then I will always have had a great life!</p>
        <p>- I want to speak in positive terms about people. It builds energy and enthusiasm in myself, people
          are attracted to people who bring positive energy, and it builds a positive image of myself. Apparently
          Richard Branson's mother would put him in front of a mirror every time he said something bad about someone, to
          show him how it reflects bad on him.</p>
        <p>-- I want to be Curious. I read <i>Surely You're Joking Mister Feynmann</i> for a masterclass in curiosity
          and
          how it brings unexpected surprises. </p>
        <p>-- I share Winning Stories. After a hard day at work, I try to share what went well, what I liked, what I did
          and
          how it made for a better day. I focus on the positive. People like to complain, but somehow we're still making
          progress, so
          we must be doing something right?</p>
        <p>-- It's ok to change my mind. As long as I can explain why. Consistency is overrated.</p>
        <p>-- I Sing and Dance whenever I can.</p>
        <p>-- Doing new things first provides fear, and then a whole lot of energy. The short term fear holds me back
          from
          the benefits lying behind it. <b>I need to look at how I will feel after the event</b>, not just how I will
          feel
          on the
          moment of maximum fear.</p>
        <p>-- I read fiction and (auto-) biographies. Biographies help me decide how to achieve my goals (see Principle
          5:
          everything has
          been done before). Fiction helps me relax, and inspires, it allows me to take on a different role and think in
          a different way (for example dressing up for a party). <i>Note: Sometimes it's time to stop reading and start
            doing.
            It's a difficult balance. If I'm only reading and speaking to people I know the latest trends, ideas,
            on which I can build. If I'm only building and never getting inputs I'm probably building in a
            vacuum.</i></p>
        <p>-- I don't eat in airplanes.</p>
        <p>-- If I can't decide the answer is "no". Decisions should be "hell yeah" or "no".</p>
        <p>-- I just want to build fun stuff (though earning 100+ USD per hour is tempting).</p>
        <p>-- Proximity is Power - Elaboration coming soon</p>
