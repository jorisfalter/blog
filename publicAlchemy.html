      <h1>Principles</h1>



      <p> How would my 100 year old self look back on my decisions?</p>

      <p>What would he like my principles to be, for the rest of my life?</p>

      <p>My grandfather died saying he had a fantastic life. I want to look back when I’m about to die and tell my
        grandchildren I
        had a fantastic life. </p>

      <p>So what is a fantastic life?</p>
      <p><i>A fantastic life is one that brings me closer to my goals, and helps me live
          according to my principles.</i> </p>
      <p>The <i>Principles</i> are what you're reading below.</p>
      <p>The Goals I might share another time.</p>

      <h2>(1) Think long term</h2>

      <p> My 100 year old self wants me to invest in things with provide joy on the long term, and in people who provide
        joy on the long term.</p>

      <p>My 100 year old:
      <ul>
        <li>Is fit and healthy and mentally at ease
        <li>Is surrounded with great people
        <li>Doesn’t depend on the government for retirement
      </ul>

      </p>



      <p> I'm not sure if this is true, I read it at the start of the Ukraine war: When he became president, Zelensky
        asked not to have a picture of him in government buildings, classrooms, ... But instead
        for
        everyone to have a picture of their children on their desk. And to think about them when making decisions.</p>
      <p>
        Naval makes an <a

          observation about children</a> on Twitter.

      </p>

      <br>

      <h2>(2) Time is my Most Important Resource in Life</h2>

      <p>I don't want to waste it.</p>

      <br>

      <h2>(3) A Joyful Life</h2>

      <p>My 100 year old self wants me to have led a joyful, energetic life, where I'm always in a peak state. That’s
        why I
        prioritise fun.</p>

      <p>I laugh violently, I make (bad) jokes,</p>

      <p>I realise some problems are massively important, but they’re easier to solve in a playful mood.</p>

      <p>I want to help people have fun. I want to make a business which is fun. That’s why I’m building in public. To
        have and ship fun!</p>

      <p>I am opportunistic - My 100 year old self doesn't want to regret not doing anything I wanted to do.</p>

      <p>I believe my mental health contributes massively to my physical health. If I am unhappy, my body
        deteriorates, so I better be joyful!</p>

      <p>I want to become financially successful as a byproduct of fun. Not the other way around.</p>

      <p> I want to see people smile as the result of an interaction with me or my products. I understand it’s
        challenging
        to see the smiles on your customers’ faces when building digital products.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>(4) Financially Independent</h2>

      <p>I probably need around 2 million USD if I want to spend 5,000 USD monthly together with my spouse. Assuming
        we
        retire at 70 and die at 100.</p>
      <p>Frankly, I never want to retire at all. Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet are prime examples. </p>
      <p>But having a backup plan is nice. </p>
      <p>The biggest potential return is probably in starting a business. That's what I want to do.</p>
      <p>I believe the best business is the one you're passionate about, so the path I'm following is building
        according
        to my gut feel until I stumble upon something that people want to pay for while at the same time it's
        something
        I passionate about.</p>
      <p> Another part of that is taking risks, for example crypto or real estate.</p>

      <p>...</p>
      <2>(5) Everything has been done before</2>
      <p>For most things in life, there is already someone who has been there before. I don't ask what I want, I ask
        who
        I want to become. </p>
