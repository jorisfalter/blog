      <h1>Principles</h1>



      <p>How would my 100-year-old self look back on my life?</p>

      <p>What would he like my principles to be?</p>

      <p>My grandfather died saying he had a fantastic life. I want to tell my
        grandchildren I also had a fantastic life. </p>
      <br>
      <p>So what is a fantastic life?</p>
      <blockquote><i>A fantastic life is one that brings me closer to my goals, and in which I live
          according to my principles.</i> </blockquote>
      <p>The <i>principles</i> are what this page is about.</p>
      <p>The <i>goals</i> are <a href="publicGoals.html">here</a>.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>(1) I want to think long term. From the perspective of my 100-year-old self (or older)</h2>

      <p> My 100-year-old self wants me to invest in things and people which provide joy on the long term. My-100-year
        old self:

      <p>(1) Is fit, healthy and mentally at ease (principle 10)</p>
      <p>(2) Is surrounded with great people (principle 5)</p>
      <p>(3) Doesn’t depend on the government for retirement (principle 4)</p>

      <br>
      </p>

      <p>At the start of the Ukraine war in 2022, I read this in a short biography of the Ukranian President Zelensky,
        who
        was
        quickly
        becoming a national hero: <i>When he became president, Zelensky
          asked not to have a picture of him in government buildings, classrooms, and other official buildings. But
          instead
          for everyone to have a picture of their children on their desk. And to think about them when making
          decisions.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Those are the kind of decisions I want to take.</p>

      <p>Most of the principles below fall in one way or another under this principle.</p>

      <br>


      <br>

      <h2>(2) Time is My Most Important Resource in Life</h2>

      <p>I don't want to waste time. Ever.</p>

      <p>I will only live once, I want it to be a life worth living!</p>


      <br>

      <h2>(3) My life should be A Joyful, Adventureous Life</h2>

      <p><b>Life is an Adventure!</b></p>

      <p>My 100-year-old self wants me to have led a joyful, energetic life. Always in a peak state. That’s
        why I prioritise fun.</p>

      <p>I laugh violently, I make jokes, sometimes bad ones.</p>

      <p>I try to make other people smile. I try to smile a lot myself.</p>

      <p>It's easier to solve problems in a happy, playful mood.</p>

      <p>I want to help people have fun. I want to make a business which is fun.</p>

      <p>I am <b>opportunistic</b> - My 100-year-old self doesn't want to regret not doing anything I wanted to do.</p>

      <p>I believe my mental health contributes massively to my physical health. If I am unhappy, my body
        deteriorates, so I better be joyful!</p>

      <p><b>I want to become financially successful as a byproduct of fun. Not the other way around.</b></p>

      <p> I want to see people smile as the result of an interaction with me or my products. I want to overcome the
        challenges
        to see the smiles on your customers’ faces when building digital products. That's why eventually I want to build
        an offline lifestyle business.</p>
      <p><b>I believe that with high energy and optimism I will always be able to create better opportunities to improve
          my
          life.</b></p>


      <br>
      <h2>(4) I want to be Financially Independent</h2>

      <p>We probably need around 2 million USD if we want to spend 5,000 USD monthly together with my spouse. Assuming
        we retire at 70 and die at 100.</p>
      <p>Frankly, I never want to retire at all. Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet are prime examples. </p>
      <p>The biggest potential return is probably in starting a business.</p>
      <p>I believe the best business is the one I'm passionate about.</p>
      <p> so the path I'm following is building
        according to my gut feel until I stumble upon something that people want to pay for, while at the same time it's
        something I'm passionate about.</p>
      <p>A <i>Throw Until Something Sticks</i> approach.</p>
      <br>
      <p> Another part of growing financially independent is taking risks, and jumping on opportunities. Sometimes a
        cryptocurrency or stock rises or declines unexpectedly. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes it doesn't. But when
        it happens,
        I better be there.</p>
      <br>
      <p><a href="https://jorisfalter.ck.page/posts/newsletter-39-the-remote-life-plan">Newsletter #39 - The Remote Life
          Plan</a> elaborates on why we need to earn independent of location.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>(5) Everything has been done before</h2>
      <p>For most things in life, there is someone who has been there before. </p>
      <p>Instead of asking what I want, I ask
        who I want to become. </p>
      <p>I admire people like Tony Robbins, Richard Branson, ... who provide strong energy while maintaining a strong
        element of fun. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>(6) I want to create opportunities through Intentional Serendipity</h2>
      <p>It's important to keep meeting people to get new ideas. </p>
      <p>I once read a story in which one person builds behinds closed doors, while the other is always chit-chatting.
        The moral was that the
        former gets a lot more done, but the latter gets less done overall, but what he gets done is a a lot more
        relevant. I believe there is truth in
        this story. </p>
      <p>I'm
        training my personality to adhere to this principle. </p>
      <p>Here's <a href="https://jorisfalter.ck.page/posts/newsletter-37-braindump">a link to my
          newsletter covering this</a>. </p>
      <p>Other people call this <i>increasing the surface area</i>.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>(7) Children Are Amazing!</h2>

      <p>It adds to Principle 3, it makes life an even bigger adventure.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>(8) I train myself to be resourceful </h2>
      <p>I want to have five solutions in my head even before reaching the Google search bar.</p>
      <p>There's always a way, I just have to figure out (See Principle 5: Everything has been done before).</p>
      <br>
      <h2>(9) I want to spend time with my parents and listen to their stories</h2>
      <p>There will come a time when they are not there anymore to tell their stories.</p>
      <p>Maybe I should write their stories?</p>
      <h2>(10) My body should be mentally and physical fit to achieve a 100 years old</h2>
      <p>If I want to become a 100 years old, I need to take car of my body, both physically and mentally.</p>
      <p>Physically it requires daily exercise and a healthy diet.</p>
      <p>Mentally it requires taking time off for myself. Time for meditation or priming, time for focused work. 15-30
        minutes per
        day would be ideal. A weekend per half year would be fantastic. </p>
      <p>Mentally it also requires a passion for what I do. A love and purpose. <i>He who has a why to live for can bear
          almost any how</i>, Friedrich Nietzsche apparently said. </p>
      <h2>(11) I try to push beyond my borders</h2>
      <p>Physically and mentally by running marathons, by doing ice baths, by doing other physical challenges.</p>
      <h2>(12) I want to be grateful</h2>
      <p>Gratitude is one of the most forces towards having a fulfilled life. We're creatures who have self-awareness,
        on a small
        spinning rock somewhere in an infinite universe, in a relative time. Ain't that something to be grateful for?!
      </p>

      <h2> Public Backlog</h2>


      <p>- If there's a reason to dress up for a party, I do it! It only has advantages: Costumes are the best, playing
        a
        role is great fun, it makes it easier to strike conversation, ... Also applies for suiting up for a night out!
      </p>
      <p>- I want to be generous. The
        secret to
        living is giving. If at moments I feel fear, or powerlessness, or I feel I don't have enough, I donate to
        charity. It
        puts me with both feet on the ground that I have abundance. </p>
      <p>- If I can make every day a great day, then I will always have had a great life!</p>
      <p>- I want to speak in positive terms about people. It builds energy and enthusiasm in myself, people
        are attracted to people who bring positive energy, and it builds a positive image of myself. Apparently
        Richard Branson's mother would put him in front of a mirror every time he said something bad about someone, to
        show him how it reflects bad on him.</p>
      <p>- I want to be Curious. I read <i>Surely You're Joking Mister Feynmann</i> for a masterclass in curiosity and
        how it brings unexpected surprises. </p>
      <p>- I share Winning Stories. After a hard day at work, I try to share what went well, what I liked, what I did
        and
        how it made for a better day. Everyone bitches about their work, but somehow we're still making progress, so
        we must be doing something right?</p>
      <p>- It's ok to change my mind. As long as I can explain why. Consistency is overrated.</p>
      <p>- I Sing and Dance whenever I can.</p>
      <p>- Doing new things first provides fear, and then a whole lot of energy. The short term fear holds me back from
        the benefits lying behind it. <b>I need to look at how I will feel after the event</b>, not just how I will feel
        on the
        moment of maximum fear.</p>
      <p>- I read fiction and (auto-) biographies. Biographies help me decide how to achieve my goals (see Principle 5:
        everything has
        been done before). Fiction helps me relax, and inspires, it allows me to take on a different role and think in
        a different way (for example dressing up for a party). <i>Note: Sometimes it's time to stop reading and start
          doing.
          It's a difficult balance. If you're only reading and speaking to people you know the latest trends, ideas,
          on which you can build. If you're only building and never getting inputs you're probably building in a
          vacuum.</i></p>
      <p>- I don't eat in airplanes</p>
      </ul>
