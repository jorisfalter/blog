      <h1>Principles</h1>



      <p>How would my 100 year old self look back on my decisions?</p>

      <p>What would he like my principles to be, for the rest of my life?</p>

      <p>My grandfather died saying he had a fantastic life. I want to look back when I’m about to die and tell my
        grandchildren I
        had a fantastic life. </p>

      <p>So what is a fantastic life?</p>
      <p><i>A fantastic life is one that brings me closer to my goals, and helps me live
          according to my principles.</i> </p>
      <p>The <i>principles</i> are what you're reading below.</p>
      <p>The <i>goals</i> are <a href="publicGoals.html">here</a>.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>(1) I want to think from the perspective of my 70-year-old self (or older)</h2>

      <p> My 100 year old self wants me to invest in things with provide joy on the long term, and in people who provide
        joy on the long term.</p>

      <p>My 100 year old:
      <ul>
        <li>Is fit and healthy and mentally at ease
        <li>Is surrounded with great people
        <li>Doesn’t depend on the government for retirement
      </ul>

      </p>

      <p>At the start of the Ukraine war in 2022, I read a summary of Ukranian President Zelensky, who was quickly
        becoming a national here: When he became president, Zelensky
        asked not to have a picture of him in government buildings, classrooms, ... But instead
        for everyone to have a picture of their children on their desk. And to think about them when making decisions.

          observation about children</a> on Twitter.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h2>(2) Time is My Most Important Resource in Life</h2>

      <p>I don't want to waste it.</p>

      <p>It's a cliche, but I will only live once, I want it to be a life worth living!</p>

      <p>I want to treat my body to make sure it can live until a 100 years old (or older!)</p>

      <br>

      <h2>(3) My life should be A Joyful, Adventureous Life</h2>

      <p><b>Life is an Adventure!</b></p>

      <p>My 100 year old self wants me to have led a joyful, energetic life, where I'm always in a peak state. That’s
        why I prioritise fun.</p>

      <p>I laugh violently, I make (bad) jokes.</p>

      <p>I try to make other people smile.</p>

      <p>It's easier to solve problems in a happy, playful mood.</p>

      <p>I want to help people have fun. I want to make a business which is fun. That’s why I’m building in public. To
        have and ship fun!</p>

      <p>I am <b>opportunistic</b> - My 100 year old self doesn't want to regret not doing anything I wanted to do.</p>

      <p>I believe my mental health contributes massively to my physical health. If I am unhappy, my body
        deteriorates, so I better be joyful!</p>

      <p>I want to become financially successful as a byproduct of fun. Not the other way around.</p>

      <p> I want to see people smile as the result of an interaction with me or my products. I understand it’s
        challenging
        to see the smiles on your customers’ faces when building digital products.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>(4) I want to be Financially Independent</h2>

      <p>I probably need around 2 million USD if I want to spend 5,000 USD monthly together with my spouse. Assuming
        we retire at 70 and die at 100.</p>
      <p>Frankly, I never want to retire at all. Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet are prime examples. </p>
      <p>But having a backup plan is nice. </p>
      <p>The biggest potential return is probably in starting a business. That's what I want to do.</p>
      <p>I believe the best business is the one you're passionate about, so the path I'm following is building
        according to my gut feel until I stumble upon something that people want to pay for while at the same time it's
        something I'm passionate about.</p>
      <p>A "Throw until something sticks" approach.</p>
      <p> Another part of that is taking risks, for example crypto or real estate.</p>

      <p><a href="https://jorisfalter.ck.page/posts/newsletter-39-the-remote-life-plan">Newsletter #39 - The Remote Life
          Plan</a> elaborates on this.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>(5) Everything has been done before</h2>
      <p>For most things in life, there is already someone who has been there before. I don't ask what I want, I ask
        who I want to become. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>(6) I want to create opportunities through Intentional Serendipity</h2>
      <p>Coming soon, here's already <a href="https://jorisfalter.ck.page/posts/newsletter-37-braindump">a link to my
          newsletter covering this</a>. Long story short, it's important to keep meeting people to get new ideas. I'm
        training my personality to adhere to this principle. </p>
      <p>Other people call this "increasing the surface area".</p>
      <br>
      <h2>(7) Children Are Amazing!</h2>
      <p>Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, having children is worth it!</p>
      <p>It can be hard, but isn't anything worth doing hard?</p>
      <p>It adds to Principle 3, it makes life an even bigger adventure.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>(8) I want to be Resourcefull</h2>
      <p>I want to have five solutions in my head even before reaching the Google search bar</p>
      <p>There's always a way, I just have to figure out (See Principle 5: Everything has been done before)</p>
      <br>
      <h2>(9) I want to spend time with my parents and listen to their stories</h2>
      <p>There will come a time when they are not there anymore to tell their stories.</p>
      <p>Maybe I should write their stories?</p>
      <h2> Public Backlog</h2>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>If there's a reason to dress up for a party, I do it! It only has advantages: Costumes are the best, playing
          a
          role is great fun, it makes it easier to strike conversation, ... Also applies for suiting up for a night out!
        </li>
        <li>I want to be grateful. I try to donate to charity when I'm not feeling grateful, when I don't feel
          abundance. The
          secret to
          living is giving. </li>
        <li>If I can make every day a great day, than I will always have had a great life!</li>
        <li>I try to speak in positive terms about people. It builds energy and enthusiasm in myself, people
          are attracted to people who bring positive energy, and it builds a positive image of myself. Apparently
          Richard Branson's would put him in front of a mirror every time he said something bad about someone, to show
          him how it reflects bad on him.</li>
        <li>I want to be Curious. I read <i>Surely You're Joking Mister Feynmann</i> for a masterclass in curiosity and
          how it
          brings unexpected surprises. </li>
        <li>I share Winning Stories. After a hard day at work, I try to share what went well, what I liked, what I did
          and
          how it made for a better day. Everyone bitches about their work, but somehow we're still making progress, so
          we must be doing something right?</li>
        <li>It's ok to change my mind. As long as I can explain why. Consistency is overrated.</li>
        <li>I Sing and Dance whenever I can.</li>
        <li>Doing new things first provides fear, and then a whole lot of energy. The short term fear holds me back from
          the benefits lying behind it. I need to look at how I will feel at the end, not just how I will feel on the
          moment of maximum fear.</li>
        <li>I read fiction and (auto-)biographies. Biographies help me decide my goals (see Principle 5: everything has
          been done before). Fiction helps me relax, and inspires, it allows me to take on a different role and think in
          a different way (like dressing up for a party). <i>Note: Sometimes it's time to stop reading and start doing.
            It's a difficult balance. If you're only reading and speaking to people you know the latest trends, ideas,
            on which you can build. If you're only building and never getting inputs you're probably building in a
            vacuum.</i></li>
        <li>I don't eat in airplanes</li>
      </ul>
