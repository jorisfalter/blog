      <h1>How we build a life in Phuket as a remote working family </h1>
      <p>I'm a remote freelancer, and launch random products from time to time. </p>
      <p>
        My spouse works on building her education business.</p>
      <p>
        Our 18 month old goes half days to a local international kindergarten, and stays with the nanny the other half.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our second one will be born in a Phuket hospital 3 month from now. </p>
      <p>It’s been six months since we moved to Phuket and both started work fully remote.</p>
      <p>
        We're building a life as a fully remote family.
        One step at a time.
      </p>
      <h2>The Good</h2>
      <h3>Sunshine And Beach</h3>
      <p>A beach is a fantastic playground for a toddler. Our current favorite is Surin as it's close to our home, and
        easily accessible.</p>
      <p>The weather is nice all year round. Between 25 and 35 degrees, with a minimum humidity of 70%. </p>

      <h3>Renting a House</h3>
      <p>We rent a house in a gated community for 43,000 thb per month (1,219 usd). Prices seem to be rising due to
        a high influx of foreigners. The style of the house is nice though maintenance and quality of materials are
        poor. The gated community offers a relatively safe area for our 18-month old to stroll around, as cars don't
        drive too
        fast.</p>

      <p>
        We're surrounded by a mix of western
        and Thai people, mostly families. </p>

      <h3>There are multiple Coworkings</h3>
      <p>Most coworkings are on the south of the island. There's only a small one in the north, and it will be closed
        soon. Homa, a real estate developer, will open a combined housing and co-working project in January 2024 in the
        north. </p>

      <h3>Full-time nannies are affordable</h3>
      <p>Having a nanny is such a luxury I'm afraid to leave Asia before the kids are old enough to be left alone. It
        was more challenging to find a nanny here compared to Bangkok, where supply outstrips demand (mostly because
        there are so many Burmese nannies). After a couple of Facebook posts we finally found a good one.</p>
      <h3>The Air</h3>
      <p>This was the main reason to move away from Bangkok. Bangkok and mainland Thailand suffers from burning season
        roughly between January and April. Phuket gets some of that, but significantly less. </p>
      <p>The air here is way cleaner I get sunburned way easily, even in non-burning season.</p>
      <h3>Healthcare</h3>
      <p>Our first baby was born in Bumrungrad Bangkok. Probably the nicest hospital I've ever seen. It could be a 5
        star hotel. </p>
      <p>Phuket hospitals aren't up to that standard, but Bumrungrad is building a hospital here now as well, due to
        open in ...</p>
      <p>Our second baby will be born in Bangkok Hospital Phuket. The service is great but the hospital itself looks a
        little worn out. </p>
      <h3>Sports</h3>
      <p>Phuket is a sportsman dream environment. The jungle is amazing for (trail) running, the sea for swimming and
        watersports (kayaking, kitesurfing, ...), the roads are great for cycling. Combine all three and you understand
        the popularity of the yearly Laguna Phuket Triathlon.</p>
      <p>Other popular sports are Muay Thai, Crossfit and Yoga.</p>
      <h2>The Challenges</h2>
      <h3>The Airbnbs</h3>
      <p>The first month we stayed in an Airbnb. While it's convenient, it won't surprise you that landlords are in it
        for
        the money.</p>
      <p>When you ever find a good landlord, cherish it. Most landlords won't go the extra mile. Unfortunately there is
        no
        incentive for them to do so (even within a platform like Airbnb).</p>
      <h2>Visas</h2>
      <p>Visas are challenging. Thailand recently raised their prices on their Elite Visas, due to high demand. In
        theory you need to buy one for your children as well, in practice they won't be fined. But they will have a
        history of overstaying visible in their passports.</p>
      <p>Immigration processes can be time-consuming. We recently spent half a day at the immigration office in Blue
        Tree. A very nice environment at least!</p>
