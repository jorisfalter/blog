            <h1>Newsletter #7: Trenitalia Scraper</h1>

            <!-- disclaimer -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height:15px"><i>This newsletter was originally published on the Revue
                    platform, which Twitter (now X) killed after being taken over by Elon Musk. I now republish it here.
                    My latest newsletters are on <a href="https://jorisfalter.ck.page/profile">Convertkit</a>.</i></p>

            <!-- newsletter content -->
            <p>TrenItalia - the Italian operator of high speed trains - uploads their schedule around 3 months ahead of
                travel date.</p>
            <p>
                It’s not exact 3 months, sometimes it’s later, sometimes it’s sooner.</p>
            <p>
                I wanted a ticket for Dec 24. And was eagerly waiting, my assumption that Dec 24 is a popular travel
                date.</p>
            <p>
                My fear became reality.</p>
            <p>
                I went to the website on average once per week.</p>
            <p> This time the tickets were available, but most tickets
                were already sold out.</p>
            <p>
                I ended up buying a significantly more expensive ticket.</p>
            <p>
                Why am I telling you this?</p>
            <p>
                As an aspiring founder, I’m always looking for problems to solve, especially in the tech sphere.</p>
            <p>
                I can slam myself in the head for not realising a bot could scrape this website daily or bi-daily, and
                send me an email when tickets are up.</p>
            <p>
                The idea was right in front of my eyes!</p>
            <p>
                Out of frustration, I decided to built it anyway. I outsourced the scraping part, and I’m building the
                mailing part right now.</p>
            <p>
                I don’t think the world is waiting for a Trenitalia scraper. But my karma says I have to solve this
                problem now.</p>
            <p>
                Your biggest frustrations are your biggest source of ideas!</p>
            <p>
                With that, I wish you a great week from the Lobby Lounge in the Four Seasons Bangkok!</p>
            <p><i>Edit Jan 2024: I found out a couple weeks later that only this route had this particular problem, it
                    never became clear why,
                    but it reduced the broader usefulness of the solution even more. </i>
